# MYTHORAS: GAME STRUCTURE & PROGRESSION DESIGN v2.0

## Terminology & Naming Conventions

Before diving into structure, establishing core terminology that fits the fantasy-meets-technology aesthetic without leaning into hard computational language:

| Concept | Term | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Creatures | **Prototypes** | Suggests engineered/discovered entities that can be perfected; fits "Technician" role |
| Player | **Technician** | Established; one who works with Prototypes |
| Endgame space | **The Protocol** | Abstract enough to be fantasy, suggests structure/rules |
| Protocol building currency | **Resonance** | Energy harvested from battles; used to construct/expand |
| Map items | **Cipher Blueprints → Ciphers** | Established; works well |
| Endgame passive tree | **The Convergence Grid** | Suggests coming together of strategies |
| High-tier modifier system | **Conduit Array** | Tetris-style idol board for advanced juicing |
| Protocol expansion items | **Echoes** | Memories/imprints of the Protocol itself |
| Boss keys/access items | **Seals** | Something that must be broken/unlocked |
| League-specific currency | **[Mechanic]-touched** | e.g., "Fracture-touched Resonance" |

## PART ONE: THE CAMPAIGN — STREAMLINED JOURNEY

### 1.0 Campaign Philosophy (Revised)

**Target Duration**: 6-10 hours first playthrough; 3-5 hours for experienced players
**Design Mandate**: Every moment serves gameplay. No filler.

**Core Principles**:
- Dialogue is skippable with a single keypress
- Cutscenes only for major story beats (3-4 total across campaign)
- UI supports rapid navigation (inventory hotkeys, quick-sort, auto-stash)
- Lore delivered through optional environmental storytelling and collectibles
- No tiering system during campaign—difficulty scales naturally with zone progression

---

### 2.0 Campaign Structure (Compressed Three Acts)

The campaign is divided into three acts, each ending with a **League Match** (gym equivalent) and culminating in the **Championship Gauntlet** (Elite Four equivalent).

#### **ACT ONE: "FIRST STEPS"** (Hours 1-3)
*8 Zones, 3 League Matches*

**Setting**: The Lowlands — established Guild territory with training grounds and early routes.

**Narrative Thread** (Optional, Skippable):
The player receives their Technician license during a period of unusual activity in the wild. Prototypes are behaving erratically. Veterans blame "signal noise." The player's assigned mentor, **Kael**, suspects something deeper but keeps concerns private.

**League Matches**:
1. **Initiate's Match**: Single-Prototype battle. Tests basic combat understanding.
2. **Proving Match**: 3v3 format introduced. Tests team composition basics.
3. **Regional Finals**: Full team battle. First real strategic test.

**Key Unlocks**:
- Full team capacity (6 Prototypes)
- Basic Motherboard Grid access
- Signal Lure tutorial
- First Ascendancy option (post-Act 1)

**Player State at End**: Functional team of 4-6 Prototypes. Understands combat, Overwhelm, basic building.

---

#### **ACT TWO: "THE RIFT"** (Hours 3-6)
*10 Zones, 3 League Matches*

**Setting**: The Borderlands — where civilization meets wilderness. Industrial ruins, corrupted territories, the first "Rifts" (zones where Protocol energy bleeds into the physical world).

**Narrative Thread** (Optional, Skippable):
The "noise" is revealed to be intentional interference. Kael disappears investigating a major Rift. The player encounters **The Collective**—a faction of rogue Technicians who believe the Protocol should be controlled, not merely explored. They're not cartoonish villains; they have a point about unchecked Protocol expansion.

**League Matches**:
4. **Borderland Circuit**: Environmental modifiers introduced (weather, terrain effects).
5. **Industrial Gauntlet**: Opponent Technicians use synergistic team strategies.
6. **Rift Championship**: Battle against a Collective-aligned Technician. First narrative boss.

**Key Unlocks**:
- Greater Signal Lures
- Cipher Blueprint drops begin (endgame preview)
- Full Ascendancy tree access
- Conduit Array tutorial (simple version)

**Player State at End**: Specialized team with clear build direction. First Cipher completed as tutorial. Understanding that the Protocol is both opportunity and threat.

---

#### **ACT THREE: "CONVERGENCE"** (Hours 6-10)
*8 Zones, 2 League Matches, Championship Gauntlet*

**Setting**: The Heartlands — the Guild's seat of power, but also where the largest Rifts have appeared. The Protocol is bleeding through.

**Narrative Thread** (Optional, Skippable):
The Collective's interference has destabilized a critical Rift. A **Pinnacle Prototype**—one of the ancient entities that exist at the intersection of physical and Protocol reality—has been corrupted. The player must earn Champion status to gain authority for the intervention mission.

**League Matches**:
7. **Heartland Open**: Top-tier competition. Opponents have endgame-adjacent strategies.
8. **Final Qualifier**: Gate to the Championship Gauntlet.

**The Championship Gauntlet** (Elite Four Equivalent):
Four consecutive battles against the Guild's finest, each a master of a distinct philosophy:

1. **The Bastion** (Defense/Attrition): Outlast and control
2. **The Tempest** (Burst/Aggression): Overwhelming offense
3. **The Weaver** (Synergy/Combo): Complex interactions
4. **The Phantom** (Disruption/Control): Deny opponent's strategy

**The Champion**:
**Archon Vex** — Guild leader, morally complex. Believes in necessary sacrifices. Not a villain, but not purely heroic. Defeating Vex grants Champion status.

**The Intervention** (Campaign Finale):
A streamlined mission (30-45 minutes) where the player confronts the corrupted Pinnacle Prototype. Victory stabilizes the immediate crisis but reveals the Protocol's depths contain far more than anyone realized. The Pinnacle, in its dying moments, shows the player a vision of what lies within—setting up the endgame.

**Key Unlocks**:
- Full Protocol access
- Journey Portal activated
- All crafting systems unlocked
- "Champion" title (cosmetic + mechanical benefits)

---

### 3.0 Campaign Characters

**Core Cast**:

| Character | Role | Arc | Motivation |
|-----------|------|-----|------------|
| **Kael** | Mentor | Disappears Act 2, returns Act 3 damaged | Protecting the player from truths they weren't ready for |
| **Nyx** | Rival | Friendly competition → reluctant ally | Proving themselves; family legacy pressure |
| **Archon Vex** | Champion/Authority | Obstacle → complex ally | "Order through control" — believes freedom is dangerous |
| **Sable** | Collective Commander | Act 2-3 antagonist | Lost someone to Protocol instability; wants to prevent future loss |
| **The Resonant** | Mysterious figure | Appears in visions; endgame relevant | Unknown until endgame |

**Character Philosophy**: No one is purely good or evil. The Collective has legitimate grievances. Vex's authoritarianism has protected people. Kael's secrecy was well-intentioned but harmful. The player's success creates new problems.

---

## PART TWO: THE PROTOCOL — ENDGAME STRUCTURE

### 4.0 Endgame Philosophy

The Protocol is Mythoras's infinite endgame—a space where players construct their own progression path, chase perfect Prototypes, and uncover a narrative that unfolds over hundreds of hours.

**Core Distinction from PoE**: 
- Turn-based combat means each battle is more deliberate but also more time-intensive
- Endgame loop must account for this: fewer, more meaningful encounters rather than rapid clear speed
- Building/construction element provides progression even when not in active combat

---

### 5.0 Protocol Structure

The Protocol is not a flat map or layered system—it's a **growing network** that the player constructs, similar to Factorio's base-building or Industrial Craft's automation, but adapted for a fantasy ARPG context.

#### **5.1 The Protocol Board**

The Protocol is visualized as a **hex-grid board** that starts small and expands as the player invests resources. Think of it as building your own atlas rather than exploring a pre-made one.

**Starting State**:
- 7-hex cluster (Core + 6 adjacent spaces)
- Core contains the **Nexus** (your command center, cannot be removed)
- Adjacent spaces are empty, awaiting construction

**Expansion**:
- Players spend **Resonance** (earned from battles, Ciphers, activities) to add hexes
- Maximum board size determined by **Protocol Influence** (earned from major achievements)
- Board can eventually reach 100+ hexes for dedicated players

#### **5.2 Hex Types**

Each hex on the Protocol board serves a function:

| Category | Examples | Function |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Generators** | Resonance Well, Echo Chamber, Signal Beacon | Produce resources over time/play |
| **Amplifiers** | Damage Conduit, Acquisition Array, Loot Magnifier | Buff Cipher runs passively |
| **Portals** | Cipher Gate, Activity Node, Boss Sanctum | Access points to content |
| **Utilities** | Forge, Trade Hub, Storage Bank | Crafting, trading, inventory |
| **Specials** | Pinnacle Shrine, Event Altar, Memory Vault | Unique functions, endgame content |

**Adjacency System**:
Hexes gain bonuses when placed strategically:
- Two Generators adjacent = +30% output
- Amplifier adjacent to Portal = Amplifier applies to that Portal's content
- Three of same type in cluster = Unlock upgraded version

**The Building Puzzle**:
Optimal hex placement becomes a strategic minigame. Do you cluster generators for maximum resources? Spread amplifiers for broad bonuses? Create specialized "wings" of your Protocol for different activities?

#### **5.3 Protocol Profiles**

Players can save and swap between **Protocol Configurations**:
- Up to 3 profiles (expandable with achievement unlocks)
- Each profile is a different arrangement of the same hexes
- Swap costs Resonance (prevents constant micro-optimization)
- Enables: "Farming profile" vs "Boss hunting profile" vs "Balanced profile"

**Reset Mechanics**:
- Individual hexes can be demolished (refunds 50% construction cost)
- Full Protocol reset available (refunds 70%, useful for major reconfigurations)
- Seasonal/League resets create fresh Protocol for competitive play

---

### 6.0 Cipher System (Mapping Equivalent)

Ciphers are the "maps" of Mythoras—consumable items that open instances within the Protocol.

#### **6.1 Cipher Basics**

**Acquisition**:
- Drop from activities, purchased from vendors, crafted
- Come in base types with different implicit modifiers

**Crafting**:
- Use currency to add modifiers (like PoE map crafting)
- Modifiers increase difficulty AND rewards

**Running**:
- Activate at a Cipher Gate hex on your Protocol
- Complete the instance (exploration + battles + boss)
- Rewards scale with difficulty and your Amplifier hexes

#### **6.2 Cipher Difficulty (Not T1-16)**

Instead of numbered tiers, Ciphers use a **Ring System** based on how deep into the Protocol they access:

| Ring | Name | Difficulty | Access Requirement |
|------|------|------------|-------------------|
| I | **Outer Ring** | Entry endgame | Campaign completion |
| II | **Middle Ring** | Moderate | 10 Ciphers completed |
| III | **Inner Ring** | Challenging | First Seal broken |
| IV | **Deep Ring** | High | Second Seal broken |
| V | **Core Ring** | Extreme | Third Seal broken |
| VI | **The Abyss** | Pinnacle | All Seals broken + special key |

**Seals**: Major progression gates. Each Seal is broken by defeating a **Protocol Guardian**—powerful bosses that appear after meeting specific conditions (Ciphers completed, Echoes collected, etc.).

#### **6.3 Juicing Ciphers**

**Minimal Investment** ("Alch and Go" equivalent):
- Use basic currency to make Cipher rare
- Moderate difficulty increase, moderate reward boost
- Accessible, sustainable, relaxed play

**Moderate Investment**:
- Craft specific modifiers synergistic with your build
- Use Amplifier hexes on your Protocol to enhance
- Noticeable difficulty spike, significantly better rewards

**Maximum Investment** ("Juicing"):
- Perfect modifier rolls on Cipher
- Stacked Amplifier hexes
- **Conduit Array** (Idol system) engagement
- Extreme difficulty, extreme rewards
- For players who want to push limits

---

### 7.0 The Conduit Array (Idol System)

The Conduit Array is an **optional advanced system** for players who want maximum control over their endgame experience.

#### **7.1 Concept**

A **Tetris-style grid** (8x8 or similar) where players place **Conduit Pieces**—items with modifiers that affect Cipher runs. Think of it as a second layer of customization on top of Protocol hexes.

**Conduit Pieces**:
- Come in various shapes (1x1 to 2x3)
- Have 1-4 modifiers each
- Can be crafted, traded, found

**Example Conduit**:
```
Shape: L-piece (4 squares)
Modifiers:
- +15% Prototype encounter rate
- Prototypes have +20% chance to be Resonant
- +10% Resonance drops
- -5% player damage (downside)
```

#### **7.2 Array Engagement**

- Filling more of the grid = more modifiers active
- Some Conduits have synergies with specific arrangements
- Can be swapped freely outside of Cipher runs
- Provides fine-tuned control for min-maxers without affecting casual play

**Design Intent**: The Protocol hexes provide broad, passive bonuses. The Conduit Array provides precise, active bonuses. Players can engage with neither, one, or both depending on desired depth.

---

### 8.0 Endgame Activities (Diverse Currency Sources)

The Protocol contains multiple **Activity Nodes**—specialized content with their own reward structures. This ensures players can engage with the content they enjoy while still progressing.

#### **8.1 Activity Overview**

| Activity | Focus | Primary Rewards | Unique Drops |
|----------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Standard Ciphers** | Core loop | Currency, Prototypes, Blueprints | — |
| **Breach Rifts** | Wave combat | High Resonance, Rift Echoes | Rift-exclusive Prototypes |
| **Memory Vaults** | Puzzle + combat | Crafting materials, rare Echoes | Memory-touched gear |
| **Hunting Grounds** | Prototype farming | High Prototype encounter rate | Perfect Imprint shards |
| **The Crucible** | PvP/Challenge | Crucible Points, cosmetics | Titles, exclusive skills |
| **Lineage Bosses** | Boss rush | Seals, unique items | Boss-specific uniques |
| **[League Mechanic]** | Varies by league | League currency | League-specific rewards |

#### **8.2 Activity Reward Philosophy**

**No Activity is Mandatory**: Every reward type can be obtained through multiple paths, just at different rates.

**Example**: Seals (boss access keys)
- Primary source: Lineage Bosses
- Secondary source: Rare drop from any Ring IV+ Cipher
- Tertiary source: Purchasable with high Resonance cost
- Trade source: Other players

**Conversion Systems**: Most activity-specific currencies can be converted (at a loss) to general currency, and vice versa. This prevents feeling "locked out" of content.

#### **8.3 Activity Node Construction**

Activity Nodes are **hexes you build** on your Protocol:
- Each Activity requires its specific Node to access
- Nodes can be upgraded for better rewards
- Node placement affects adjacency bonuses

This creates meaningful Protocol building decisions: "Do I want to specialize in Breach Rifts or spread across multiple activities?"

---

### 9.0 Endgame Narrative: The Echo War

The Protocol's endgame narrative unfolds gradually, revealed through gameplay rather than forced cutscenes.

#### **9.1 The Setup**

During the campaign finale, the dying Pinnacle Prototype shows the player a vision: the Protocol is not empty. It contains **Echoes**—imprints of Technicians who delved too deep and were absorbed. Some Echoes have grown powerful. Some have agendas.

**The Core Mystery**: What is the Protocol, really? A tool? A prison? A living thing? Different factions have different answers.

#### **9.2 The Factions**

Three major powers contest the Protocol's depths:

**The Resonant Choir** (Discovery/Expansion):
- Believe the Protocol should be fully explored and understood
- Led by **Echo-Sage Yuri**, a Technician who has partially merged with the Protocol
- Goal: Map everything, claim everything
- Player relationship: Ally of convenience; their ambition may be dangerous

**The Covenant of Silence** (Containment/Control):
- Believe the Protocol's depths should remain sealed
- Led by **The Warden**, identity unknown (possibly a former Champion)
- Goal: Prevent anyone from reaching the Core
- Player relationship: Obstacle, but their warnings have merit

**The Synthesis Collective** (Transformation/Ascension):
- Evolution of the campaign's Collective faction
- Believe humans should merge with the Protocol, becoming something new
- Led by **Sable** (campaign antagonist, evolved)
- Goal: Achieve transcendence through Protocol fusion
- Player relationship: Antagonist, but their logic is seductive

#### **9.3 Pinnacle Technicians**

Deep within the Protocol exist **Pinnacle Technicians**—legendary figures who achieved mastery and chose to remain within the Protocol rather than return. They serve as Mythoras's uber-bosses.

| Pinnacle | Ring | Philosophy | Combat Theme |
|----------|------|------------|--------------|
| **The Architect** | IV | Creation | Spawns constructs, terrain manipulation |
| **The Arbiter** | V | Judgment | Punishes mistakes, rewards perfection |
| **The Dreamer** | V | Illusion | Phase shifts, reality distortion |
| **The First** | VI | Origin | Unknown until encountered |
| **[Expansion Boss]** | Beyond | TBD | TBD |

**Pinnacle Technician Battles**:
- Multi-phase encounters with unique mechanics
- Require specific preparation (not just raw power)
- Defeating them grants permanent Protocol bonuses + chance at their unique items
- Can be challenged repeatedly but rewards diminish after first clear

#### **9.4 Narrative Progression**

The story unfolds through:
- **Environmental storytelling** in Cipher instances
- **Echo fragments** collected during activities
- **Faction reputation** built through choices
- **Pinnacle Technician dialogue** (they talk during battle)
- **Memory Vault** discoveries (optional lore dungeons)

**Player Agency**: The narrative doesn't force a "correct" path. Players can align with any faction (or none), and their choices affect available content and rewards, not a "good/bad" ending.

#### **9.5 The Power Fantasy

As players progress through Rings, they should feel:
- **Ring I-II**: "I'm exploring something vast and mysterious"
- **Ring III-IV**: "I'm becoming a force within the Protocol"
- **Ring V**: "The factions seek my allegiance; I matter here"
- **Ring VI**: "I stand among legends; what will I become?"

The narrative serves the power fantasy—players aren't just grinding, they're ascending.

---

## PART THREE: TURN-BASED COMBAT INTEGRATION

### 10.0 Combat Loop Considerations

Mythoras's turn-based combat fundamentally differs from PoE's real-time action. The endgame must account for this.

#### **10.1 Pacing Differences**

| Aspect | PoE Real-Time | Mythoras Turn-Based |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Battle duration | Seconds | Minutes |
| Battles per hour | 100+ | 15-25 |
| Decision density | Low per battle | High per battle |
| Clear speed importance | Critical | Moderate |

**Implication**: Mythoras cannot rely on "clear speed meta." Rewards must be balanced around fewer, longer encounters.

#### **10.2 Cipher Design for Turn-Based**

**Standard Cipher Structure**:
- 3-5 exploration segments with ambient encounters
- 2-3 "elite" encounters (Charged/Resonant Prototypes)
- 1 boss encounter
- Total time: 15-25 minutes

**Reward Distribution**:
- Small rewards throughout (keeps engagement)
- Major rewards at boss + completion
- Bonus rewards for optional objectives (acquire specific Prototype, complete in X turns)

#### **10.3 Intervention Mechanics**

Inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh's chain system, Mythoras combat includes **Intervention**:

- Certain moves/abilities can be used during the opponent's turn
- Creates depth: "Do I save my interrupt for their big attack?"
- Prototypes can be built around intervention (control builds)
- Adds strategic tension to each turn

**Combo Systems**:
- Moves can chain for enhanced effects
- Team synergies reward planning multiple turns ahead
- Successful combos grant bonus Resonance in endgame

---

## PART FOUR: LEAGUE FRAMEWORK

### 11.0 League Structure

Each league (13-16 weeks) introduces fresh content and competition.

#### **11.1 League Content Types**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **New Region** | Campaign expansion with new zones, Prototypes | "The Sundered Isles" — coastal region with 6 new zones |
| **New Mechanic** | Endgame activity added to Protocol | "Fracture Rifts" — unstable zones with unique rules |
| **New Prototypes** | Species additions to existing regions | 15 new Prototypes distributed across all regions |
| **Meta Shift** | Balance changes, new Skill Cards, Grid updates | Ascendancy reworks, new Conduit types |

**Typical League**: 1-2 of the above. Major leagues get new regions; minor leagues get mechanics/Prototypes.

#### **11.2 League-Specific Rewards**

Each league mechanic has unique rewards:
- **League currency**: Specific to that league's mechanic
- **League Prototypes**: Found only through league content (migrate to standard after league)
- **League Conduits**: Special Conduit Array pieces
- **League cosmetics**: Time-limited visual rewards

#### **11.3 League-to-Standard Migration**

When a league ends:
- Characters migrate to Standard
- League mechanics may be added to Standard (with reduced spawn rate)
- League-exclusive items become tradeable in Standard
- Protocol progress carries over (no full reset)

---

## PART FIVE: EXPANSION ROADMAP

### 12.0 Expansion Philosophy

Major expansions (annually) add substantial content. They should feel like "the next chapter" rather than just more of the same.

#### **12.1 Expansion Template**

Each expansion includes:
1. **New Campaign Act** (optional, continues story) OR **New Region**
2. **New Pinnacle Technician** (endgame boss)
3. **New Champion Technician** (returning character or new rival)
4. **New Activity Type** (endgame variety)
5. **Signature Mechanic** (defines the expansion's identity)

#### **12.2 Example Expansion: "THE SEVERANCE"**

**Premise**: A section of the Protocol has been cut off—a "dead zone" where the rules don't apply. The Collective (evolved into Synthesis Collective) caused it intentionally.

**Content**:
- New region: The Severance (5 zones, unique environmental rules)
- New Pinnacle: **The Severed** (Technician who merged with the dead zone)
- New Champion: **Vector** (survived the Severance, learned to manipulate it)
- New Activity: **Fragmentation Runs** (unstable Ciphers with randomized modifiers)
- Signature Mechanic: **Severance Contamination** (corruption system affecting Prototypes and gear)

---

## APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Prototype Naming (Terminology Confirmation)

"Prototype" works because:
- Implies something that can be perfected (matches gameplay of hunting perfect stats)
- Fits the Technician aesthetic (we work with Prototypes)
- Distinct from Pokémon, Digimon, or other competitors
- Sounds appropriately serious for the game's tone

**Usage Examples**:
- "I caught a Resonant Prototype with perfect Imprints"
- "My team has six fully-ascended Prototypes"
- "That Apex Prototype took 50 encounters to find"

### Appendix B: Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Prototype | Mythoras's creatures |
| Technician | The player character |
| The Protocol | Endgame space/system |
| Cipher | Map item for endgame instances |
| Resonance | Primary endgame building currency |
| Echoes | Protocol expansion items; also narrative entities |
| Seals | Boss access keys |
| Rings | Endgame difficulty tiers (I-VI) |
| Convergence Grid | Endgame passive tree |
| Conduit Array | Advanced modifier system (idol-style) |
| Pinnacle Prototype | Legendary creatures |
| Pinnacle Technician | Uber-bosses |

### Appendix C: Open Design Questions

1. **Protocol Visual Style**: How abstract vs. literal should the hex board look? Fantasy map? Digital interface? Hybrid?

2. **Conduit Array Complexity**: 8x8 grid may be too large for casual players. Consider 6x6 with expansion?

3. **Ring VI Access**: Should The Abyss be truly exclusive (1% of players) or achievable with dedication (10%)?

4. **Faction Reputation**: How deep should faction mechanics go? Mutually exclusive rewards? Alliance switching costs?

5. **Turn-Based Boss Pacing**: Pinnacle Technician fights may run 20-30 minutes. Is this acceptable for uber-boss content?

6. **Protocol Profile Limits**: 3 profiles enough? Should additional profiles be achievement-gated or purchasable?
