Introduction and Design Philosophy

Origins and Domains are the two fundamental axes defining a creatureâ€™s identity in Mythoras. Rather than a simple â€œsingleâ€typeâ€ system, each creature has an Origin (its mythic archetype or lineage) and one or more Domains (its elemental or conceptual power sources). Origins capture who the creature is at its core (e.g. a dragon, a golem, a pack of insects), while Domains capture what kind of power it wields (fire, water, metal, psychic, etc.). This dual-classification creates deep asymmetry and choice: a creatureâ€™s strengths and weaknesses can come from both its Origin and its Domain, making matchups more complex than a single type chart. The system is explicitly designed for player agency and modular buildcraft. Players pick creatures they like and can retool them via affixes, the shared passive â€œMotherboardâ€ tree, gear and moves, ensuring even â€œoff-metaâ€ choices can become viable with clever planning. Our guiding principles are asymmetry (unusual resistances/weaknesses and one-way edges), meaningful choice, and modular progression. In short, Origins give each creature a rich identity and unique passive traits, and Domains shape its elemental affinities â€“ together they drive strategic synergy and theorycrafting.
Origins: Mythic Archetypes and Their Influence

Origins are the mythic â€œracesâ€ of creatures, defining their heritage and baseline traits. Each Origin typically leans on one or more core attributes (Authority, Invictus, Order, Animus, M.Y.T.H.) and carries an innate trait (a passive or ability) and stat biases. For example, Martial origins are warriorâ€types (high Invictus and Order) focused on physical combat, often with a trait like â€œCombat Disciplineâ€ (boosts physical moves or grants extra strikes); Scalesbourne are draconic/reptilian (tough builds, often high strength) with something like â€œScaled Hideâ€ for damage reduction; Mystique are pure magic beings (high Animus, frail) with â€œArcane Bodyâ€ (magic resistance or mana regen); Psybourne are psychic minds (Animus/Authority) with â€œThird Eyeâ€ (crit or intel-based bonuses); Primal are wild beasts (Invictus/Animus) with â€œPrimal Furyâ€ (enrage on low health); Nocturne are shadowy/undead (Authority/Animus) with â€œNight Stalkerâ€ (lifesteal or fear effects); Avatar are elemental paragons (often high Authority) that can channel any element (e.g. gaining buffs when using their bound Domain, or even swapping Domains via special skills); Automata are constructs (Authority/Order) with metallic or electric themes (often immune or responsive to tech damage); and Aggregator are swarms or composite creatures (often tied to high M.Y.T.H.) with abilities like â€œCombined Mightâ€ (extra minions or hybrid bonuses). Stat Tendencies: each Origin influences base stat growth. For instance, Martial and Scalesbourne generally yield higher physical/health stats, whereas Mystique and Psybourne yield more mana/magic power. Origins also align with attribute hybrids (e.g. Martial with Invictus+Authority/Order; Mystique with Order+Animus).

Foundry Imprint and Implicit Affixes: Each creature also spawns with a Foundry Imprint â€“ one or more implicit affixes chosen from an Originâ€ and Domainâ€influenced pool. These are permanent bonuses or abilities tied to the creatureâ€™s makeup. For example, a â€œRockhide Lizardâ€ (Martial/Seismic) might have â€œTough Hide: 5% physical damage reductionâ€, while a floating â€œSky Jellyâ€ (Mystique/Tempest) might have â€œAerial: Evade all Ground movesâ€. These Implicit Affix pools are unique per species (and variant), ensuring thematic consistency. Variants of a species can have different implicits: e.g. an â€œEmber Foxâ€ (Avatar/Infernal) might get â€œEmber Spirit: +5% Burn chanceâ€, while a volcanic variant â€œAshen Foxâ€ has â€œAsh Coat: â€“10% physical damage takenâ€. As a result, selecting a creature involves weighing not just its Domain but also its Imprint. Origins contribute to these Imprints (e.g. Automata favor sparks/shock-themed mod pools, Nocturne favor curses or lifesteal mods), shaping each creatureâ€™s â€œbuiltâ€inâ€ strengths and weaknesses from the outset.

Asymmetric Origin Interactions: Origins also have loreâ€flavored interactions beyond simple resistances. We introduce oneâ€way strengths: for instance, undead Nocturne might be essentially immune to mind-type Psybourne attacks, but vulnerable to pure Mystique arcane power. Conversely, a Martial hero might naturally fare well against fragile Mystique wizards or mechanical Automata (brute dismantling machines), yet find Armoured Scalesbourne dragons a tougher match. These subtleties encourage players to consider team composition at the Origin layer as well (e.g. including a Nocturne when facing Psychic foes). In sum, Origins define a creatureâ€™s identity and innate toolkit (stat biases, trait, Implicit Affixes), create native gear affinities (weapons or Armour styles that fit the theme), and determine starting locations on the shared passive grid (for example, Automata paths lie toward Authority/Order nodes, Mystique near Animus nodes).
Domains: Elemental and Conceptual Forces

Domains are the â€œtypeâ€ of damage and power a creature uses (like PokÃ©mon types). Each Domain represents a fundamental element or force and has associated tags, ailments, and resistances. Domains serve as damage types in combat, and all damage is classified under a Domain (e.g. a fire spell is Infernal, an earthquake move is Seismic). We use consistent names (e.g. Infernal instead of â€œFlameâ€, Tidal for water, Voltaic for electricity, etc.) to avoid confusion. Each Domain has a theme and an attribute lean: for example, Infernal (fire/heat) leans on Authority/Order and focuses on burning, explosive attacks; Tidal (water/ocean) leans on Invictus/Animus and emphasizes fluidity or cleansing water effects; Seismic (earth/stone) is strong and tanky (Authority-heavy); Glacial (ice/cold) brings chilling effects (Animus/Order); Voltaic (electricity) is about speed and chain damage (Invictus/Animus); Metallurgy (metal/steel) covers physical piercing and Armour (Authority/Order); Venom (poison/toxin) inflicts strong damage-over-time and corrosive effects (Invictus/Order); Shadow (darkness/curse) focuses on lifesteal/curses (Authority/Animus); Psionic (mind/telepathy) is high Animus (pure mental power); and so on. We also plan Radiance (light/holy) as the thematic opposite of Shadow, and possibly others like Tempest (wind), Arcane/Ethereal (raw magic), or Void (chaos) for late-game.

We classify Domains into thematic clusters: for example, Elemental domains (Infernal, Tidal, Seismic, Tempest) are the classic elements; Material/Compound domains (Glacial, Voltaic, Metallurgy, Venom) involve materials or complex states; Supernatural domains (Radiance, Shadow, Psionic, Arcane) cover light, dark, psychic, and mystical forces. This 4Ã—3 matrix clarifies affinities and resistances. In combat, each domain has certain strengths and weaknesses against others (we will use a resistance system rather than fixed type matchups to reduce bookkeeping). For instance, Infernal (fire) is naturally strong against Glacial (ice) and â€œburnsâ€ organic foes, but weak to Tidal (water) and perhaps Seismic (earth). Voltaic (electricity) is strong versus Tidal (water conducts electricity) and Metallurgy (metal conducts), but grounded by Seismic (earth) and ineffective versus Shadow. Light (Radiance) and Shadow are true opposites: light energy dispels darkness and vice versa. These relationships are deliberately asymmetrical: e.g. light might cleanly counter shadow, but shadow may counter psychic or others more broadly. Crucially, a creature resists its own Domain (an Infernalâ€Origin dragon has innate fire resistance), but can be vulnerable to other Origins or Domains (fire dragons fear water). We also allow mixed or dual-element moves, and conversion mechanics: e.g. a claw strike might be â€œimbuedâ€ 50% as Infernal damage, changing its interaction with defenses.

In practice, Domains tie into skills and tags. A creatureâ€™s Domain affinity informs its move pool (Infernal creatures learn fire spells naturally, etc.) and the damage type of its attacks. It also determines common ailments: Infernal inflicts Burns, Glacial inflicts Chill/Freeze, Voltaic inflicts Shock, Venom inflicts Poison, etc. Creatures typically resist their own elementâ€™s status (a fire-type is immune to Burn) but may be especially vulnerable to certain others. For example, an Infernal Scalesbourne (fire dragon) will be a powerhouse of flaming breath attacks (scales plus flame), but will have severe weakness to Tidal (water) damage. A Mystique + Glacial build (ice elemental fairy) would specialize in chilling magic and tricks, while Nocturne + Venom (undead serpent) excels in stacking poison DoTs and lifesteal, but is vulnerable to Radiance (holy) attacks. These Domain traits cascade through gear and affixes: e.g. gear with â€œ+% to Infernal Damageâ€ will boost a flame mage, while skills tagged [Infernal] get bonuses.
Synergies Between Origins and Domains

The true strategic depth comes from combining Origins and Domains. Each pairing creates a distinct build with its own scaling and affixes. For instance, a Scalesbourne (Origin) + Infernal (Domain) is essentially a fire dragon: it blends high Authority/Invictus with explosive fire breath, and its affixes might favor both strength and fire damage. By contrast, a Mystique (Origin) + Glacial (Domain) ice elemental sprite combines high Animus with ice control spells, scaling spell power while being glassy physically. Another example: a Nocturne + Venom undead serpent focuses on poison DoT and life-drain (high Authority/Animus for curses and resilience), but suffers against holy (Radiance) attacks. These combinations guide skill choice and passive node priorities: a Voltaic domain creature will seek [Chain] projectiles or shock bonuses, while a Martial origin leans into strength nodes.

Some synergies can be explicitly planned. For example, water (Tidal) moves might leave targets â€œSoakedâ€, enabling the next Voltaic (electric) attack to automatically chain through soaked enemies. An electric swarm (Voltaic Aggregator) could exploit this: its multi-hit insects become conduits for chain lightning, spreading damage rapidly. Conversely, an Infernal Scalesbourne might use passive nodes like â€œignite amplifiersâ€ to turn every hit into a multi-stage fireball. Origins add another layer: an Automata origin might enhance any [Mechanical] or [Electric] move it uses, whereas a Mystique origin could boost [Spell] tags. Players will often build around these synergies, e.g. choosing gear that adds â€œ+% to Tidal (water) Damageâ€ for a marine-themed build, or selecting passives that multiply a Domainâ€™s key status (like extra Shock duration for Voltaic).

Finally, origins and domains both shape team strategy. A well-rounded team will spread out its Domains to cover weaknesses (just as PokÃ©mon trainers carry mixed types) and include complementary Origins (an Avatar origin can buff all teammates of any element, a support-type Mystique can adapt to various needs). Some Origins grant team-wide perks (e.g. an Avatarâ€™s Inspire aura buffing all fire allies) and some Domains confer global effects (e.g. an arena with a water domain theme empowering Tidal moves). Thus, planning involves both vertical build depth and horizontal team diversity.
Affix Modularity: Innate, Implicit, and Explicit Systems

Mythorasâ€™s affix system is highly modular, mirroring how PoE handles items. There are three tiers of modifiers:

    Innate (Species) Affixes: These are fixed attributes or minor perks inherent to a speciesâ€™ design (not normally â€œrolledâ€). For example, every Scalesbourne might innately have bonus Armour, or a Legendary species might start with extra sockets. These ensure each creature feels unique at baseline.

    Implicit Affixes (Foundry Imprints): As described, every caught creature has one or more random implicit affixes tied to its Origin/Domain. These come from a domain- and origin-specific mod pool. For instance, Automata-origin creatures have a pool of gear-like implicits related to metal or shock, whereas Primal-origin implicits involve life/mana on hit. These implicits significantly shape a build (they are like special abilities or item mods built into the creature) and cannot be easily changed. They reflect both Origin and Domain: e.g. a Tidal Domain beast might roll â€œWater Veil: +regen in rainâ€, whereas a Venom Automata might get â€œCorroded Armour: +% Poison Damageâ€. These affixes are permanent, forcing players to catch or craft the right creature with desired Imprint.

    Explicit Affixes (Gear/Engine): Gear and augments can add mods to creatures much like in an ARPG. Items (like collars, bracelets or gene-mod relics) have explicit affixes drawn from pools influenced by the creatureâ€™s Origin/Domain and the region where it was found. For example, a weapon might roll â€œ+20% Infernal Damageâ€ (boosting all fire moves), or a support relic might add a chain or multistrike tag to an attack. Affix weightings are tied to Domain: Infernal-affinity creatures can craft more fire damage rolls, Automata can get more metal/electric rolls, etc. Progression currencies (rare crafting items) and endgame â€œtarget farmingâ€ allow further refinement: e.g. using a special idol to improve an Infernal damage stat, or defeating a Domain-aligned boss to harvest a gene mod for that element. Over time, players optimize the affix pool via endgame activities: adding modifiers from the Motherboard tree, hunting variants with better implicits, or using coordinate imprints to tweak passive nodes.

In short, Origins/Domains + species determine an evolving affix ecosystem. Each creatureâ€™s gear affixes synergize with its Origin (e.g. an Automata knight equips items that add Physical/Metal bonuses) and Domain (e.g. focusing elemental % damage). Implicit and explicit mods can be mixed freely: a single creature might wear gear adding to any Domain, or even convert damage types via passives. This modularity ensures that builds remain flexible: players might, for instance, convert a physical move to Voltaic on one build, then to Infernal on another, by swapping affixes and passives.
Skills, Tags, and Damage Scaling

All creature moves carry descriptive tags that drive interactions. Tags include broad categories like [Attack], [Spell], damage types (e.g. [Infernal], [Tidal], [Psionic]), and behavior tags ([Projectile], [AoE], [Chain], etc.). Skills are treated much like socketed support gems: you slot moves and then can apply modifiers or skill â€œlinksâ€ that act on tags. For example, a passive might give â€œ+20% Projectile Attack Damageâ€ to anything tagged [Projectile] [Attack], or an Origin ability could say â€œAutomata spells add 10% Voltaic damageâ€ (automatically affecting every [Spell] move the Automata uses). Consistency in tag names is crucial: we always use our chosen domain names (e.g. Infernal, Tidal, Glacial, Psionic, etc.) in affix text, and use clear modifiers (â€œincreasedâ€ vs. â€œmoreâ€) so players instantly know how a buff stacks.

Tags also tie directly to Domains: a move tagged [Infernal] will scale with Infernal damage bonuses, trigger Burn ailments, and be resisted by fire resistance. Choosing supports or passives that boost your primary tags is key. For instance, an Infernal-focused build might seek gear with â€œ+X to [Infernal] Spell Damageâ€ or motherboards nodes that add stacks of Burn. Likewise, creatures can adapt their damage vector: a raw punch might remain Neutral (Physical), but a modifier could convert 50% of it to an elemental domain, changing its scaling.

The battle tags enable powerful synergies. A [Chain] tag lets a lightning bolt arc between enemies; [Pierce] lets arrows hit multiple foes; [AoE] marks explosive areas. Unique combos emerge from tag interactions: for example, a [Status] tag on a water move could inflict â€œSoakedâ€, and then a [Voltaic]-tagged chain lightning will automatically bounce extra times through soaked targets (mimicking electricity conducting through water). Another concept: hitting a poisoned target with a fire [Infernal] attack could trigger â€œCombustionâ€ â€“ consuming the poison to deal bonus area damage. These mechanics are not hard-coded to each move but come from how tags and affixes interact, making the system extensible.

Importantly, we expose tags to the player for clarity. A move tooltip will list something like Infernal Spell, AoE, Projectile, so a player knows that Infernal-boosting gear will help and it can chain or multistrike. We will provide a lexicon of tags. In practice, this means builds are very transparent: â€œMy Scalesbourneâ€™s [Infernal] Breath is AoE, so Iâ€™ll boost Area damage and fire damage,â€ or â€œMy Automataâ€™s attacks are [Physical] [Melee], so I invest in raw strength nodes.â€ Tags thus knit together Origins, Domains, and affixes into clear damage-scaling vectors.
Strategic Implications and Progression Dynamics

The Originâ€“Domain system shapes team and individual progression deeply. Teams will naturally spread Origins and Domains to cover enemiesâ€™ advantages (e.g. bring a Radiance caster against Shadow bosses). Encounters (bosses, tournaments, dungeons) will be designed around particular Origin/Domain themes, forcing players to adapt. As creatures level and evolve, they retain their Origin and Domain, but can gain new ones (a Pinnacle Evolution might add a secondary Domain or extra Origins buffs) and always keep the backbone of their identity. The shared passive â€œMotherboardâ€ tree has region clusters aligned to Origins/Domains; as players invest points in, say, the Animusâ€“Order hybrid area, they passively empower all Animus-aligned Origins/Domains.

Progression also includes variant scouting and Pinnacle Evolutions. Players can hunt variants (via special areas or consumables) that have different Implicit Affixes or minor Domain shifts, giving new build options. Pinnacle Evolutions (akin to PoE ascendancies) can add whole new skill engines or even a second Domain tag (for example, an Avatar/Infernal Ninetails might ascend to an Ifrit Foxlord with an extra â€œMysticismâ€ Domain tag). Crucially, the active progression is through choices: every level and quest gives points and gear, but itâ€™s up to the player how to apply them. The Motherboard tree and coordinate â€œImprintâ€ jewels allow late-game fine-tuning of your creaturesâ€™ Origin/Domain affinities (for instance, a jewel might boost all your fire creaturesâ€™ crit chance).

Overarching all this is team synergy. Some Origins and Domains have support utilities: Avatars buff alliesâ€™ element, Mystiques may copy or alter spells, Aggregators enable swarm tactics. Players will balance offense and defense: an Authority-heavy tank origin might pair with a defensive Metallurgy domain and a supportive Animus ally to cover its weaknesses. Encounters will exploit the system: a â€œBeast-sylvanâ€ themed zone might pit wild Primal Forest creatures (nature-themed) against specific vulnerabilities, rewarding teams that used their Bladehunter (Martial/Seismic) or Raincaller (Mystique/Tidal) well.
Design Notes and Examples

    Example Build â€“ Voltaic Aggregator: Imagine an Automataâ€origin swarm of stormy lightning beetles. As an Aggregator, it passively summons micro-minions, and as Voltaic domain it zaps enemies. Its skill choices include multistrike lightning shards (tagged [Voltaic][Projectile]) and chain bolt volleys ([Voltaic][Chain]). Implicitly, it might have â€œStatic Aura: +X% Shock Chanceâ€. The player gears it with modifiers like â€œ+% to Voltaic Damageâ€ and invests in passive nodes that boost chain or crit. In combat, it soaks and zaps through crowds with Electricity+Soaked synergy.

    Example Build â€“ Infernal Scalesbourne: A dragon (Scalesbourne origin, high Authority) bound to Infernal. It learns burning breath and Claw/Smash (physical). Its traits: high Armour (Scales) plus pyromancy. Implicit â€œScaled Hideâ€ gives damage reduction. The build path emphasizes Authority/Invictus nodes and Infernal damage nodes. Equipment with â€œ+Infernal Damageâ€ and skills with [Infernal] tags (like a fire â€œPhalanxâ€) are primary. The dragonâ€™s weakness to water is offset by crafting a Driftwood Shield or picking Radiance-hybrid skills. In battle, it breathes lines of flame (Ignite status) and charges in with fiery melee, exemplifying the synergy of Origin and Domain.

    Ailment Combo â€“ Frostbite: A Golem (Automata/Seismic) casts an acid poison ([Venom] tag) on an enemy, then the player follows with a cold attack ([Glacial] tag). The system can trigger a â€œFrostbiteâ€ combo â€“ poisoning lowers Armour, cold shatters it for bonus damage. This uses tag logic (acid â†’ poison build-up, then freeze) to create novel interactions beyond single type effectiveness.

    Bullet Seed (Rapid Fire) Strategy: A fast Invictus origin Ranger with [Physical][Projectile] bow attacks could use a support node that grants Multistrike, turning â€œTriple Arrowâ€ into a five-arrow volley. Tag [Projectile] benefits from swarm-style supports; tag [Multistrike] times the hits. This showcases how tags (Rapid/Multistrike) provide build depth.

Key Design Takeaways: The Originsâ€“Domains framework is engineered for depth: every choice (which creature to catch, which Origin/Domain to focus, how to affix items and nodes) affects the outcome. It intentionally avoids one-size-fits-all: no build is trivial, because strong offense (high damage) usually has a weakness (fragility, misaligned affixes, etc.), and vice versa. The passive grid and affix systems allow any creature to be viable if properly built. Accessibility is addressed by obvious color-coding and tags (players see blue water creatures, red fire creatures) and clear terms (â€œ+% increased Infernal damageâ€ rather than confusing jargon). Over the long term, as players collect creatures, gear, and points, the Originâ€“Domain system will enable thousands of unique builds â€“ from a frost-breathing avatar that summons ice clones to an earthâ€‘crawling bug queen that melts Armour with venomous acid â€“ all grounded in the solid spine of Origin and Domain synergy.
