Game System: Creature Encounter & Acquisition

1.0 System Philosophy & Overview

The Mythoras Encounter & Acquisition system is designed around a core ARPG principle: the hunt for the perfect chassis. It is a semi-deterministic framework that empowers players to strategically influence encounters without entirely eliminating the thrill of the chase and the excitement of rare, unexpected "jackpot" moments.

The primary goal is to move away from purely random encounters and give the Technician (the player) agency. Through the tactical use of consumable items and endgame crafting systems, players can solve specific build challenges and target-farm creatures that fit their team's needs.

A foundational pillar of this system, and Mythoras as a whole, is that all creatures are designed to be endgame-viable. Through deep customization via the Technician's Grid, Creature Ascendancies, and the hunt for powerful, species-specific Foundry Imprints, even creatures acquired early in the campaign can become cornerstones of a top-tier endgame team. This ensures a focused roster where every creature maintains a unique and lasting identity.

2.0 Core Creature Classification

Creature identity and value are defined by a dual-classification system, creating a clear and compelling loot hierarchy.

2.1 Species Tier (Lore & Base Potential) This is a creature's inherent, lore-based classification that determines its base stats, general availability, and innate complexity. Some higher-tier species may be exceptionally rare or entirely unavailable during the main campaign.

    Common

    Mythic

    Legendary

2.2 Encounter Rarity (ARPG Modifiers) This is a dynamic rarity applied to a creature during an encounter, similar to monster rarity in Path of Exile. It determines the number of random combat modifiers the creature possesses, increasing its difficulty and the quality of its rewards.

    Standard (White): No special modifiers.

    Charged (Magic/Blue): Possesses 1-2 combat modifiers.

    Resonant (Rare/Yellow): Possesses 3-5 synergistic combat modifiers. A significantly tougher fight that drops higher-quality loot, including valuable Signal Lures.

    Apex (Unique/Orange): A named, unique variant of a species with a distinct appearance and a fixed set of powerful, often build-defining abilities. These are chase creatures that can offer unique, team-altering synergies.

3.0 The Acquisition Mechanic: "Overwhelm"

Acquisition is a skill-based challenge integrated directly into the turn-based combat system, moving beyond a simple "weaken and capture" loop.

    The Resolve Bar: Every wild creature possesses a Resolve Bar displayed beneath its Health Bar. To acquire a creature, this bar must be depleted to zero before its health is.

    Depleting Resolve: Resolve is damaged by demonstrating tactical superiority, not just raw damage. Key methods include:

        Exploiting Domain/Origin weaknesses for Super-Effective damage.

        Successfully applying debilitating ailments (e.g., the Paralyze from Electrocution).

        Executing specific multi-stage combos or using utility-focused moves.

    Outcomes:

        Overwhelmed: If the Resolve Bar breaks first, the creature is acquired at the end of the battle.

        Defeated: If the Health Bar depletes first, the creature is defeated and yields standard loot but cannot be acquired.

4.0 Campaign Progression: The Signal & Resonance System

During the main League campaign, players influence encounters through a lightweight, consumable-driven system designed to fit seamlessly into the ARPG gameplay loop.

4.1 The Scouting Toolkit Accessible via the Hub View (the game's "Football Manager" style dashboard), the Scouting Toolkit is a dedicated UI where players can load and manage consumable Signal Lures. This provides a satisfying, low-friction preparation layer before venturing out from the Departure Grounds hub.

4.2 Signal Lures These are the primary tools for targeted farming during the campaign.

    Function: Consumable, currency-like items that, when activated from the Scouting Toolkit, grant a temporary buff for a set number of encounters (e.g., "The next 3 encounters have a greatly increased chance to be of the Infernal Domain").

    Acquisition: Lures primarily drop from defeated creatures, with higher drop rates from Charged and Resonant encounters. Basic types may be purchasable from vendors for a high currency cost.

    Progression: Lures have scaling tiers (Lesser, Greater, etc.). Higher-tier lures, which offer more potent or specific effects, will not drop below certain zone levels, creating a natural progression of farming capability.

4.3 Supporting Consumables The encounter loop is supported by other familiar ARPG currency items:

    Identification Scrolls (Name TBD): Used to reveal a wild creature's full set of Foundry Imprints and base attribute rolls before the Technician commits to an acquisition attempt.

    Portal Scrolls (Name TBD): Used to open a portal back to the Departure Grounds hub, allowing for a quick return after a successful acquisition.

5.0 Endgame Progression: The Network Cipher System

After the campaign, the system evolves into a deep, craftable, and highly scalable endgame loop centered around the Network Cipher.

5.1 Ciphers & Cipher Blueprints These are the core "map" items of the endgame.

    Cipher Blueprints: The craftable base item. Blueprints drop in the late campaign and endgame and come in various base types (e.g., "Contaminated Cipher," "Fortified Cipher"). These bases can roll exclusive sets of powerful modifiers, similar to influenced maps in Path of Exile.

    Ciphers: A Blueprint becomes a usable Cipher once it has been crafted with rarity and modifiers using the game's standard currency system. Activating a Cipher at the "Journey" portal in the Departure Grounds opens a portal to a custom-tailored, high-level instance.

5.2 The Network Grid This is the "Atlas Passive Tree" for Mythoras. As players complete objectives within Ciphers, they earn points to allocate on this expansive grid. The grid contains nodes that enhance the Cipher system and allow players to specialize their endgame farming strategy (e.g., boosting the spawn rate of Apex creatures, increasing the drop chance of specific Signal Lures, etc.).

5.3 Progression Arc (Endgame Loop) The primary endgame loop consists of running Ciphers to acquire currency, better Cipher Blueprints, and high-level creature "chassis." Players will constantly tweak their Network Grid to specialize in key endgame content. This loop can be further augmented by other endgame subsystems, such as a potential Phrecia Idol system, to add additional layers of challenge and reward. This creates a deep and endlessly engaging chase for the rarest creatures with perfect stats.

6.0 The Technician's Journey & Decision Making

This section outlines the expected player experience and the key strategic decisions at each stage of the game.

6.1 Early Campaign (League Tiers 1-3)

    Player Experience: The Technician is a rookie learning the ropes. The focus is on building an initial roster and understanding the core combat mechanics. The player is introduced to the Overwhelm system and begins finding their first Lesser Signal Lures. The world feels vast and full of potential, with every new creature a valuable addition.

    Key Decisions:

        Resource Management: "I only have two Lure of the Infernal. Do I use one now to get a type advantage for this difficult League opponent, or save them for a zone where Infernal creatures are more common?"

        Risk vs. Reward: "This is my first Charged creature. Should I risk trying to Overwhelm it for a potentially stronger team member, or just defeat it safely for the guaranteed loot and experience?"

    Expectations: Players should expect to assemble a functional, diverse team capable of clearing early campaign content. They will learn to appreciate the value of lures for solving immediate tactical problems. Finding a Resonant creature at this stage is a significant and exciting power spike. The hunt is for function, not perfection.

6.2 Mid-to-Late Campaign (League Tiers 4-8)

    Player Experience: The Technician is now a seasoned competitor. They have a steady supply of various lures and understand their strategic importance. The concept of a creature as a "chassis" with desirable Foundry Imprints becomes central. The player begins to think about specific builds and synergies, actively hunting for creatures that fit a long-term plan. The node-based map, as seen in areas like the "Hill of Sunshine," becomes a strategic puzzle to navigate for optimal farming.

    Key Decisions:

        Strategic Farming: "My team lacks a solid tank. I will travel to a Tectonic-heavy biome, use my Greater Signal Lure of the Tectonic, and specifically hunt for a creature with defensive Foundry Imprints like '+% Maximum Health'."

        Evaluating Potential: "I found a Resonant creature of the species I want, but its imprints are mediocre. Is it worth the time and resources to acquire it as a stopgap, or should I defeat it and continue my hunt for a better chassis?"

    Expectations: Players should expect to have a well-defined primary team with clear synergies. They will have acquired multiple Resonant creatures and may have had a rare, memorable encounter with a wild Apex creature. The first Cipher Blueprints will begin to drop, signaling the transition to the endgame and shifting the player's focus towards future possibilities.

6.3 Early Endgame (The First Ciphers)

    Player Experience: The League Champion becomes a Network explorer. The player has completed the campaign and now faces the vast, scalable challenge of the Network Cipher. The focus shifts from a linear path to a self-directed grind. The initial goal is to build a map pool and begin unlocking the Network Grid.

    Key Decisions:

        Initial Investment: "I have my first Cipher Blueprint. Do I run it 'white' to safely learn the mechanics and boss, or do I invest some currency to make it 'magic' for a chance at better rewards and my first Network Grid point?"

        Atlas Specialization: "Which path on the Network Grid should I take first? Do I prioritize nodes that grant more Cipher drops to sustain my mapping, or nodes that increase the chance of finding Resonant creatures to improve my loot per map?"

    Expectations: Players will be learning the core loop of the endgame: run Ciphers to get more Ciphers and currency. They will make their first significant crafting and investment decisions, shaping their long-term farming strategy. The power level of their team will increase dramatically as they acquire creatures from high-level zones.

6.4 Deep Endgame (The Perpetual Hunt)

    Player Experience: The Technician is a master of their craft, a true endgame grinder. They understand the game's economy and complex systems. The hunt is now for perfectionâ€”the Legendary Apex creature with triple T1 Foundry Imprints, the final piece of a perfect build. The player is "juicing" maps, using advanced currency, different Cipher bases, and endgame-specific fragments to create incredibly difficult and rewarding encounters.

    Key Decisions:

        High-Stakes Crafting: "I am hunting a specific Apex creature. I will buy a 'Contaminated' Cipher base, use currency to roll 'Area contains an additional Apex' and other synergistic mods, and add fragments to further boost rewards. This is a huge investment, but the potential payoff is worth it."

        Economic Strategy: "Is it more profitable for me to run my own crafted Ciphers, or to specialize my Network Grid in a specific mechanic and sell the resulting resources (like high-tier lures or specific creature chassis) to other players?"

    Expectations: The player is engaged in a long-term, self-defined chase. Their gameplay is a cycle of investment, risk, and immense reward. They are interacting deeply with all of the game's systems and potentially the player-driven economy. This is the endlessly scalable loop that provides long-term retention for dedicated players.
