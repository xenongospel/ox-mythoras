Stuff for Mythoras

Resistance Stat Caps against different damage types.
Each Defensive Layer has a matched piece of gear which may offer benefits.

For example: Energy Shield Body Armour has Spirit, Armour has additional life, etc... 
- Creatures in Mythoras have a Protocol that can affect a body part similar to Bankai. For example, Sceptile might gain a Bankai of his leaf blades incurring more damage or greater critical chance (it's a blend of a unique that is slotted to a particular section of gear associated with tags.
- Consider distance and projectile or action speed in combat simulation. For example, a bullet speed with greater acceleration like spark in Poe 2 is just as effective a multiplier as.,.
-  Crafting language and implementation should be easy to understand and universal to both high and low level crafters.
- Different contract types to allow different experimentation types like in NBA (Exhibit-1 contract, 2 way contract, max contract, etc...)
- My game might be more so related to this thread:https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1f8keot/arevtur_the_ultimate_gear_upgrader/ 
- Look for games like Antimatter Dimensions, Lootun and NGU IDLE. Layout might need to improve.
- Myxus Names:
   - Kordial (Sceptile)
   - Acryllix (Excadrill)
   - Cyperius
- Potentially add rest slots in phase combat
- Loot Filter should highlight on the loot screen. There should also be move all highlighted and other operations including sort
- There should be consideration 
- Add a corruption (malware) that can defintively change the internal mechanism of every system in the game and affect it in severe ways. It can be successfully aggressive and remove modifiers, degrade the object and straight up remove all modifiers (technically can be upgrade if the malware is removed with another mechanic in the game. On the plus side, a successful thwarting of the malware increases potency of the item giving it potentially up to 3 more modifiers, a chance at a random modifier from outside of its original scope or increase the gear's level and therefore it's modifier and potential. Many areas to play with on this.
- Zone and Monster Level big determiner on the level of loot. Parameters and influencers also have impact on the loot received from combat.
- Snapshots will be invalid on gear or moves that have all modifiers on it.
- Think about battles in their meta sense with openers, finishers, breakers and setup.
- Magic find for enhancing loot picked up. Rarity/Quantity. Think about best way to implement.
- Tournament juicing for greater content.
- Infernal, Tundra, Storm are outer class
- Fire, Cold, Lightning are base class

- Look at the paper from creator of F.E.A.R who created G.O.A.P (Goal oriented action planning), to determine AI logic from standard state machines and behaviour trees.

- Items have generally good implicits that x1.2 multiplies their effects during damage calculation while crafted modifiers are standard and enable certain interactions. Implicit and Meta crafting will be the endgame ideals once currency and reputation are built up for gearing and affecting Myxus implicits.

- Would be cool to have an algorithm like approach to the social feed that makes it feel like you are scrolling on a twitter like forum but for your own content. Like a bot farm on twitter.

- MVP v2 should possibly incorporate a rendered hideout that the player can walk within to interact with content and look at the myx they own along with staff hired and various different facilities. Very large change.
Hideout should be what the dashboard is called.

- Do we need resistence from the Identification System? Should there be more ways to determine mods that are good without it?

- Gain additional experience and loot from creatures with loaded modifiers.

- Trial of Chaos like entity that can be done where sacrifice can be spawned from special keys for harder competitions and introduce greater prizes.

- Crafting. There should be at least 3/4 stages of crafting.
   - Rolling, Essence like semi-deterministic crafting, 3/4 deterministic crafting and mirror crafting

- Biomes
  - Battles taking place in certain environments will provide additional stat differentials, boosts and drawbacks for each creature in play.

- Phases for different parties involved in combat. (Fire Emblem can have monsters, bandits (enemy) and the player playing in the same combat field).

- Profiles so that players can switch between builds on a creature very quickly.

- Instead of time, we could probably have a familiarity setting on new moves introduced by the player as inefficient and thus cause the creature to underutilize energy as well as increase the potential damage that could be done with the move with a wider range. As the creature becomes more familiar, they will reduce the scope of damage and generally use less mana to cast the move.

- Mythics of interest section in Transfer View

- During amateur competitions, there is less restrictions on what is considered 

- Chase Items are highly important. Some ways we could do this is to make certain legendary Technicians available as combat options with specific drops. They might bring a new team everytime they are defeated. They might also rundifferent gear or know alot about the player's team and so attempt to create interesting traps surrounding it.
    - Good chase options include: Final few levels for Mythics, Really build defining uniques (Temporalis, Queen of Forest with Corruption of some type), for example, Critical chance on first turn, Meta Modification Items that allow for highly deterministic crafting in specific ways. (Needs to be a few different algorithms to rea
- Interesting way of doing battle royale like battles where it is 2v10 or something of that nature. This would allow for allowing players to feel more. For example, it might be for an expedition like game mode, choosing a matrix of thing to destroy unleashes a series of creatures to battle.
- Characters will have 3 offensive gear slots (The third is via a chase item and is locked until retrieved).
         - There are double oriented weapons that effectively augment the creature's primary method of damage.
                   - So for example, Gardevoir would have access to a wand or a sceptre/staff that can augment Aurora or aurora (arcane/psyphic) damage while Sceptile would have a choice between daggers/claws/wand/staff/sceptre to augment different damage type build paths. For tank oriented creatures, they should still have offensive build paths but should still make them tanky. So for example, focuses and shield and perhaps a heavy duty attack item. Thinking however in the vein of an all 4s tank pokemon like iceberg tank pokemon how we create items for it. 
- First tournament will act as a pseudo campaign and allow players to play the game. It will provide campaign bonuses that can then extend towards others while players work their way up the ladder.
- Instead of suffix, prefixes, implicits and corruptable modifier on each item in the game, each item has an engine/soc/sys/executable that can be loaded into each game object in the game. There are base types and ones that can only be slotted into specific game objects but they similar to a motherboard govern the elements of a gameobject like a cloak (body armor)
- Mythics taken into battle can have 3 profiles. These are minor changes such that they allow for limited variability in playstyle and dealing with specific enemies.
- AI will have boss like creatures as their final Mythic with specifically tailored engines
- Rotate Primary and Support doesn't cost a turn but switching in from the back does.
- Damage Type: Primed for ... (Primed for Freeze, Electrocution, Ignite, Crit).
- Counter and Disengage type of moves and playstyles that are not toxic.
- Interesting names for gear like X-Wing Bow
- Skill Effect Duration per turn could be cool
- Energy Shield acts like Leftovers in Pokemon where it will generate shields per turn. This will be in turn for removing things like leftovers and immense healing type builds (though this niche will still be semi viable)>.
- Stuns could make it so that specific tank matchups don't stall excessively.
- Crit maths help https://youtu.be/QRGpfmRYqt8
- Game mode similar to Trial of Chaos where if you get a key, you can unlock access to a game mode where you can face specific trainers. I also want to do a parody one where you can face a translated version of high profile pokemon characters like Red, Blue, Brock, etc...
- Names for types of names like Herald in game: Nova, Novic,
- Two states of crafting. One to manipulate immediately found gear and materials and another system for base crafting.
    - Several ways to craft an item on release (5) -> Nocturnal Crafting, Computational Crafting, -> Network Crafting, Fractured Crafting, Deep Neural Crafting
      -> Mythics are bound to already scouted Base Item that can be used as an external loadout in battles. They are distinct gear that as the player and mythic levels they are able to improve the base of the item. This can be sold and re-bound to slot in another item.
- Fallen Crafting
- Networking Crafting could be something like changing the network configuration such that the item's domain changes.
- GGG mode w/ Sockets
- Auto Pickup on loot filter
- Basic Currency Items available in store to buy.
- Domains have a limit on the shared passive tree.
- Blacksmith Affinities is a cool thing from Slormancy. Look at the game.
- As a new Technician, you are going to have to sign up with a pre-established Guild that will help fund your training.
- Active skills in play (for example: PoE2 Solar Orb) can cause differences in effects.
- Names: DeVyper,
- Simulated Trade Website where loot obtained from AI targets are propogated on the Trade Site as authentically and performantly as possible. This should technically come from simulated loop these AI agents are provided. This will be slightly lazy but should provide a feel good factor.
- Item Types:
    - Uniques are split into 3 types
    - Diamond, Amethyst, Obsidian
    - Diamond is the most malleable with unique modifiers that are built into the implicit of the item but can still have additional modifiers added to them albeit only with 4.
    - Amethyst has more less open modifiers built in but maintain more unique modifiers.
    - Obsidian are the least malleable with almost entirely unique modifiers built into it and no open slots for modification in normal fashion.
    - Each item base should have an implicit regardless. It feels bad when there isn't one. There should also be 2 craftable slots that allow for semi-deterministic slots on each item for a cost using the Tooling Bench that can be improved by rank over time like meta -crafting, etc. Then there should be a way to change the parameter system into our own thing. 
- Have something to replace the quality aspect of an item.
- Bracket Layer <...>
- Motherboard Skill Tree should have clusters, a couple of routers, proxies, channels and a distributive network to connect motherboards of other creatures together with the current creature.
Quality acts like jewellery catalysts and can be used on multiple gear. Quality has quite a tangible deterministic effect similar to breach rings as default and a group of items has a greater quality range.
- Play into rare mods on gear that will enable greater base setups. You can create a snapshot 3 times on base gear picked up to make them better to craft on.
- Projectiles would be cool with a blend of something like of a pokemon move like icicle spear combined with how projectiles work in Path of Exile. It might be that we allow to hit multiple targets with their own rolls.
- Create some interesting small systems that are similar to the concept of Critical Chance.
- Each creature will have a set of splash art and potentially some skins to augment and provide customizability. I also want to offer MX and microtransactions as well.
- Each creature might have a voice line and some interactions could be interesting regarding rivalry and
- - Timeless jewel idea translated to Operating Systems. "Welcome Progenitor of the Vaal. You have been conquered!"
- Endgame Pinnacle Bit Technicians. Specialized endgame bits that each have a different unique quirk. These are bosses that introduce unique drops used to make certain creatures moves, gear and other configurations incredibly powerful.
- Something equivalent to choking out experience points from the enemy key carries in order to extend lead.
- Critical Defense.
- Interesting layers of defense that could be built around like spell suppression, elemental thresholds, block chance, evasion, dodge. Need ways to make each factor unresistable.
- Could have some fun play with abilities like Frenzy when on low life. For example, bladed primal type attacks become lucky when on low life (Sceptile).
- Aspects of the ... => Principal of the Void
- Super Max contracts that mean that creatures never leave you.
- AI assistant who helps to set the mood.
- Calendar progression system will solely for the time being be based on certain events and matches. Otherwise, a specific state of the world can be used to manage existing creatures.
- Alive rules based on rare dynamically generated events that could cause self propogating consequences like a change in the rules of the game what happened for Petr Cech regarding goalkeeper safety.
- Gain fans as a means to increase income and currency generate more
- A creature like Draven's cash in mechanic merged with Gemling Legionnaire to create a creature that generates more resources and has an effect on loot based on creatures it gains an advantage on.
- Move Builder using a component structure like Liam ERD that has move template pools and modifiers. Might also use for crafting views that allows for custom elements to be in specific places.
- Should creature ascendencies (add something similar to the ascendency demigod in PoE) be decided by tghe Technician class ascendency or should they be individual.
- Scorpion creature
- Keystones => Signals
- Forbidden Flame/Flesh to allow for creatures to use ascendancy node from another creature.
- Tattoos => Imprints
- Name: Fulcrum, Mettle, Affliktiona, Xerxe, Kryptix
- Old timey jazz/shanty crew could be cool. Like translate sh'boom or lance armstrong into shanty like music like One Piece songs.
- Different insanely difficult challenges that require very strong parties of creatures, that are highly min/maxed in order to gain perform.  (https://youtu.be/Az5rIhF4kTY?t=600)
- Interesting items like Adorned
- Pacing should ideally be to get through early game (roughly 1-20 quite quickly and get to the large mid game part before getting to late stage end game builds).
- Shared passive tree is split into Principle Domains in order to accomdate and scale the different Domain Types in the game and incorporate the core attributes. So for example, the principle of primal carnage might be an Authority/Maloseum but can still access witch/ephemeral parts of the tree.
- Move Idea: penance brand of destruction (poe) equivalent. Attach mine during first phase, detonate during second phase dealing aoe damage.
- 5 game modes on release: Blight equivalent, Sanctum *(Network oriented conquer the subnet type of game)* using a loose network mask wrapper concept around the game to determine complexity and doability, Capture the flag network type of game with your creatures, Mapping type competitions and pinnacle bossing (conquer) the 8 bits to face the final byte). complete circuit 3 times to conquer a byte and  unlock pinnacle variants with yu-gi-ohj color rarity to access chase loot to make creatures god-like) and then a RTS variant of the game that allows more flexibility. Need to figure out a different turn-by-turn based version of the game and police procedural contracts inspired by heist. If possible use pokemon narratives from red and blue to spite gamefreak.
- Game simualations offer optional content the player can perform to get additional loot. One of them will include a mandatory mission once a threshold has been reached in order to engage with the police force. Once the mission is completed, the player can optionally help the police force by completing contracts stopping specific criminal gangs. More prominent criminal gang mess ups will enable safety in zones and thus extra loot.
- Sanctum game mode health is based on the collective health of your creatures actively tethered to the main character.
- Defensive mechanics that I already really like: Fortification, Spell Suppression, Defensive Stance (Block), Evade, Stealth, Dodge (Natural to al species), Placeholder for Armour, Shield (umbrella for 3 main types of shield) energy, momentum (primal phys), fortify shield. 
- Cipher Networks are our version of the atlas but slightly different. (It merges the concept of Pokemon regions and battling the elite four and extends it to the single atlas layer system in  Path of Exile with pinnacle content to create an 8 Subnet Cipher Network Framework that players must complete. Each pinnacle boss has it's own dedicated atlas that players must battle in order to obtain invitations.
- Would be cool to have wands like in PoE that can also influence authority/physical related moves. This might 
- Influence = Principal Domain Declaration (PDD). Gear, equipment and abilities are able to be declared with a given principle from each of the pinnacle vectors that can augment the nature of the entity influenced. Base moves turn into a new dynamically created type of move that slightly changes an aspect of the move. Gear is changed to include certain parameters not seen in other domains and creatures under specific influences receive minor variance.
- Specific vendor provides this after completing the 1st pinnacle of the endgame.
- Beserker type creature with a specialisation that increases effects he gains from a Rampage attack subsystem. (Checker the Phrecia Marauder Beserker class).
- Explicit Dodge/Block to increase probability of escaping a hit.
- Activity/Social Feed. See Theo3gg stream manager social feed.
- Mods like "Hits can't be evaded. Might also be included in a specific creature's ascendency"
- Also Mods like "Spells can't be suppressed"
- Acquire low level gear quite easily for testing, experimenting and prepping future runs to acquire certain things at a lower level/doing another campaign run.
- Base template move names: Storm Rain, Galvanic Rage, ...
- be useful for a creature/pokemon inspired by Sceptile.
- Plantary Fixtures/Tether (small condition/small reward) - incubator
- Interesting concept of phys claw, magic claw (by having chaos/spell damage and potentially enabling specific builds like crit ethereal abilities.), chaos/poison claw and other types of ways with parameters to change bases of gear and moves.
- 12 trials of hercules (used for pinnacle bosses)
- Quantum Ring (Unstable) = You are allowed to set 2 deterministic ranked parameters. Lose 2 slots. For each parameter, you set you gain 100%-(n parameters * 25)#
- Gateway = Builds off of the cluster jewel tech from PoE where you build gateways based off of an initial cluster building out gateways to portals that extend from your motherboard skill tree or might be a seperate network oriented one. Each cluster you add (like an array) provides greater functionality or utility to your network (party) or specific creatures).
               - The only deterministic item in game. Craft 1-12 more passives that you can allocate as an additional extension of passive board. Specific currency to amend passive points (small, medium, large). Base type of cluster jewel affects type of move, amount of skills (1-3 moves/1 ultimate move). Ultimate moves spawn their own support passive skills that users then allocate.
- Each map in the game should provide the distribution of monsters that are to be expected in each battle. So using a map from PoE like infested valley, it should be 50% poison/chaos, 10% to ...
- Different types of gear provides so many ways to path. Include this within the overall integrated mythological domains that a player can commit to whilst also providing a different playstyle.
- Creature/Technician power governed by a mixture of parameters like the current area level the player is in, ...
- Specific types of loot filters for specific modes (Blight has all currency enabled and less general items while mapping has stricter currency and more open to certain mecahnics of items).
- Each of the domains has a representative tied to it similar to the Pantheon. These are extraneous creatures similar to Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, Rayquaza so on soforth. Gaining their favour provides a blessing to you that distributes to your squad. These are similar to PoE pantheon except relates more closely to the underlying game narratively.
- Timeless Jewel Coordinate system to specific areas of the shared motherboard that creates a zone of operations that can increase specific parameters of the build.
- Similar to PoE, it should be particularly in the network mapping that players feel the obstacle present, farm, overcome, obstacle, farm....
- 2nd action bar to handle proxies (auras) to help in specific situations
- Motherboard bridges similar to shaper/elder bosses
- Juice competitions and other mechanics using a translated Scarab + Idol + Proxy system (three tier layer) with the last one helping with targeting of hyper specific loot but with a high bandwidth cost.
- Action Speed vs Execution Speed 
- A move must be compiled and executed. There are attacks that can be performed without it but moves require a specific action speed that takes some time in the phase. Certain move templates can hit multiple times (above 2 attack speed).
- Inspired socket system for our game requires "Completing the circuit" where sockets with particular colors provide bonuses if socketed with correct color thus becoming a minmaxer optimization rather than a hard core limitation. This also means that early game, people focus on linking nodes and node counts in the circuits to create an optimized base skill.
- Types are considered locally and globally. Local Wheels of types (Elemental, Ethereal, Divinity) for example, represent local rock/paper/scissors and then interact with global domains differently providing a damage enhancement and an additional premise.
- Domain Influences that affect mod pool and global influence, Dual influence or rare tri-influence params dilute global in favour of greater local power,.
- Certain styling and aesthetics for some of the tower defense blight like mechanics:
 https://github.com/curly60e/pyblock
- Variants of certain creatures give different types of loot (capable of making target farming far more accessible). These are also seen in tournaments as Abrupt Events where if the player is able to slain it, the creature will provide a greater volume of loot that can be used.
- Last Epoch crafting and item relationship system is incredibly good.
- Remembering layouts similar to PoE would be great.
- Would be fun to take the concept of Team Rocket and the other villain teams and combine them using the concept of Assassins Creed Assassins and Templars creating small sects that the player can defeat to gain specific unique rewards and act as another farming mechanism. It might even be the case we can combine with Jun's board but with greater depth and offering different ways to help the police.
- Boss encounters/Increase pack size on white, magic and rare variants that can be affected and one shot by AoE variants.
- We can have the 1st encounter with the pinnacle boss system introduce the idol/scaling farm progression systems such that you can target certain mechanics and ramp up their general complexity and reward system through different craftable modifiers.
- Headhunter like item that allows you to acquire modifiers from defeated mythics.
- Artificier blacksmith type creature (myx) that has minion like elements, In the same way, a necromancer type creature (like Magneton nucleus controlling multiple creatures) can be thoughtt about as well.
- Crafting in game during battle by allowing a crafting action. This will require each action understanding how much is lost per phase.
- Unique encounters (like Rogue Exiles) that become problems for characters (like Death in Puss in Boots) each of which have iconic loadouts and signals (whistling specific songs);.
- Would be fun to have it so that attack rate of certain projectile attacks like bullet seed are calculated both in DPS and in DPP (damage per phase) where the attack rate per phase could be well over 12-33 if built towards (like Sceptile going crit bullet seed with no interruption or stun disruption (status effect against channels) causing potentially millions of damage (extended more so by environment advantages).
- Increasingly innovatative defensive layers (suppress spell damage, etc...)
- Crafting mechanics that can allow for interesting modifiers to be added to certain specific item groups like suppress on es armor allowing for easier capping of suppress
- Non standard crafting alternative for certain gear pieces that use the Smith of Kitava ascendency like passive (potentially crucible league item variant that can have specific nodes at a far lesser condition).
- Old reddit theme for social feed and showing reactions that players can also interact with.
- I really like the "Socketed skills are supported by lv1-20 skill" as it allows for very high end optimization without relying on links. In order to achieve this, we can introduce a bounding mechanic that binds a move to a rune like object that can be socketed in gear thus binding the gear to the move and providing the supported implicits inside. (If we do not want to rely on gear bounding we can make it an independent mechanic that only affects the move itself. Have to be careful of static mechanic interaction and potential conditions/limitations.
- Rogue Exiles in the campaign that drop all gear if defeated potentially springboarding player
- Permanent effects to Technician (like venom pit item that gives 1 of 3 choices)
= Loot filter has 3 modes that can be configured and toggled by clicking the mode change button and cycling. It should also show the current mode of the loot filter in the current configuration toggle button.

- Feelings from Most Wanted in this game
    - Variety of game modes
    - Base species should feel manufactured, specific in personality and feel
    -  Attempt to tie the concept of the Blacklist and potentially hidden motivations in game from static NPCs.

- Prestige of the blacklist and potentially something similar to the Treble.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzD9Uc7bRK0
- Delve is like this or a challenge league that is incredibly difficult.

- Two superpowers in Void Func world within Eucledeus fighting along two distinct grounds could be interesting that is subliminal to the global plot and experienced later (could be power of productivity and manufacturing in China representing a more Dragonball Saiyan view of primitive and illiberalism vs the other side that is less productive and easier to exist in but fragile and weak with many spolied people coming out of it (https://youtu.be/UqBa0hBAQBA?t=1139)

- Xen can be a character who within we explore the finesse of the world's different infrastructure (crafting orb and manufacturing, financial, education and govrneance along with new embedded systems from network oriented fixtures.

- Vaal Orb bosses.

- Conflux Items (Implicits, Explicits -> Prefix, Conflux, Suffix) Conflux is a fusion of a single mod that contains a unique affix built from shard chance.

- Charges => Channels (Endurance, Primal, Milotic, Resonance)

- Interesting ways to create expansive layers of narrative depth within the world with Luffy when he is knocked off of his rowboat by 

- Story idea for character or new story where MC who is semi rookie assassin has to protect and lead the king/prince consort through the house torn battlefield using his sensors and Brakken eyes and semi limited protocol with his daughter. During this time and many close calls, he leads them to a cellar beneath the castle  before re-entering.
- Research theme for atlas with certain computation/engineering or perhaps programming subtle fantasy mechanics that translate what Path of Exile's Atlas and game mechanics do like Blight.

- Crafting Ideas:
    -> Implicit inspired by Helical, Simplex item bases in Path of Exile but instead the more affixes added to the item, the lower the overall bonus all the way to 0% for 5-6 mods with the starting being 75%.
    -> Consider removing class of items (magic, rare, etc...) entirely and build up an item
    -> During crafting, hold a specific affix in state that can be swapped with another. 
            -> A lot of balancing (potential for the crafting currency to be rare for this),
    -> Crafting bench states that can provide an additional mod pool in hideout that extends personal crafting bench
    -> Pinnacle bosses provide exalted like forbidden tier affixes along with specific implicits.
    -> Fabled (Crucible League) Items where weapons of a specific variant gain experience and each level would gain a specific weapon type affix. Can name the weapon.


-> Dynamic changes in the world caused by new factions, treaties changing scope of competition, etc... and game simulation progression should help content feel distinct and alive.

 Factions
 -> You can join the Police Bureau and specialise in a specific department (for target farming specific mechanics and/or uniques) or work for a specific Team based underground team fighting against the bureau like in Pokemon with Team Rocket. Each gives you a specialisation.

Vendor recipes
-> Allow players to create certain base types if they have other resources in unique ways that can be intuitive but also can be researched and allocated. (potentially within glossary in game). Feels more like a market. In Path of Exile, selling a transmute/blue gem/augment/alteration with a silver ring could allow the user to get cold resistance ring that could be used to get enough resistance to fight merveil the first boss with better defenses. We can introduce this slowly but maintain mystery in-game by forcing the player within theme'd battles to consider the vendor recipe. Shapeless crafting from Minecraft is effectively vendor recipes so perhaps we can have something similar like a crafting station that can achieve this or something like it.

- Interesting weapon types
    - Traps/Explosives
    - Turrets
    - Claws/Dagger/Wings/
    - Proxy/Catalyst/Resonator (self cast beam like effects) (offhand) (resonator for electric type engine that specifically targets enhancing specific attacks particularly those that increases power of internal mythic powered moves like Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, etc...
    - Sword/Axe/Spears (1h)
    - Staff/Sceptre/Wand
    - Sword/Mace/Axe/Quarterstaff (2h)
    - Firearm
    - Bow/Crossbow
    - Shield

Can use interesting concepts from Yu-Gi-Oh like synchro summon or fusion but instead on Affix's to create dynamic affixes 
-> “synthesize” two affixes

Players can change the profile of a creature which includes the gem setup making single target, AoE and potentially a third profile instantly available to the user during combat. There are some drawbacks./

Can short circuit a skill to create an evolved/vaal like version of the skill with a modified/different set of parameters. Thunderbolt into Thundershock increases shock magnitude by 50% and increases chance to shock.

Sequence Automation
-> Mid-Late endgame oriented battles start working off of higher chains (Think of constructing Yu-Gi-Oh chains with moves.) The reason it typically occurs at this stage is that gear and certain creature affixes enable this to happen with at more extensive volume causing phases to take a degree longer time to execute. It might be that a single phase introduces a number of overlapping mechanics that execute before a favorable attack taking advantage of those occurs (This can be skipped to just the damage calculation step to avoid fatigue). These can be packaged into a Sequence that can execute at distinct phases automatically depending on creature affix.

Settlers Mechanic. 
-> The key things people like about Settlers are:
   -> Shipping (Exports), Mapping and Recombination
-> Other parts are quite tedious and uninteresting. So perhaps we setup general automation and just get players to control the inputs and outputs. Or we can setup patterns that players can target their exports to perform in order to generate loot passively. We can make it so that it is an optional mechanic maintained within the overworld as well. Then players can determine how much inputs, the general process and the governing output should be.

Intention -> Process -> Execution
- The reasoning core makes default assumptions based on the intent of the command structure sent to it. This can be at odds with the user's intention in high pressure moments particularly if it occurs unnaturally from normal disposition. Training this reasoning compatability will be similar to observation haki where that intent can play vital roles in major battles against opponents with this mastey.

Crafting items called agents
Agents currency orbs

Chaining Sequences
-> Battle invokes similar concepts to Yu-Gi-Oh chain sequences.

Move Creator
-> Might be cool to have Inheritance like capabilities for skill manipulation (inherits all projectile base except chain/pierce operations).

Different types of uncommon ailments
-> Yoked - Become unable to specifically apply full shield value
-> Blighted - You are necrossed leaving your mental state fragile. reduce ...
-> Uncertainty - Confusion surrogate

Parameters/Modifiers to avoid specific bucket of ailments or specific debillitaing ones like Sleep, Freeze, etc...priva

Verbs
-> Gain as
-> Transpose to
-> Compile as
-> AND/NOT/OR/XOR damage

System Cluster design.
Cluster Jewel type of component system building for skills and a certain technician system that can enhance overall team and certain type actions.

Idol/Atlas Passive System
-> Idol for random amplifiers to the passive tree
-> Passive tree secures base line loot progression
-> Idols can enhance specific modifiers for each mechanic
      -> Multiple idols to increase overall pinnacle technician creature spawn gauntlet
      -> 

Spell Burst
-> Spell version of crit but with different mechanics.

Bog Shaman ascendency design would be good (from Phrecia)

Ezxtreme Divergence (T17) blueprints that are the hardest content in the game and provide the most loot. Amplifiers are tempered and scale with modifiers.

Make obvious global vs local context modifiers and when certain supports affect each (ice bite vs ice infusion)

Could make resource generation moves that act as a part of the sequence (in order to limit amplifier moves like Swords Dance having the moves gated before being executed by accruing resources in a single phase. But that can be overturned by interesting affix modifiers and potentially passive tree nodes.

Perhaps a new defensive layer that amplifies the others more so than provides one. (Something like Evasion, Armour, etc... get a percentage increased based on Resonance value.)

Could be interesting to have interesting active/offhand weapons that are different to default current setups (bow quiver), (sword/wand sheild/focus) for example. Perhaps only a Martial Domain of creatures are able to use defensive stances naturally when dual wielding providing passive point differences.

Intro early muling
-> Starter gives access to specific moves it can learn early. Each starter for the base will be for each of the 9 Domains -> Origins first and then Domains second (come later in campaign)

Instead of gear, creatures might have augment slots and controllers.
There are three major controllers (Body Armor, Helm, Jewellrey (Rings/Amulet)). Then there are augment slots depending on configuraiton of the creature (claws, sceptre, etc...) combined with ... Minimal ways to increase initiative as a scaling vector. Could use terminal terminology (Rings/Amulet => Interfaces Rings or Interface Ports), Sensory Unit (Helmet).

Blight Ravaged maps (vectors for jackpot in rewards).
https://youtu.be/0BJ45F8yyjA?t=881

Practice Battles
-> A mode that can set a configured solo or multi creature encounter that can help to test builds.

Modules
-> World Mods
     -> Changing the current tournaments for specific loot or some type of specific encoutner.
-> Battle Mods
     -> Could be for a new expansion of the game, battles can be fiddled with specific types of gems before executing to modify increase/decrease quantity, rarity and efficacy of the battle at the expense of risk like Maps in PoE


Each damage type should have a thematically good theme surrounding it.
-> Lightning = Better AoE
-> Cold = Better utility and setup and single target king
-> Fire = Better single target, AoE, Damage over Time 
-> Frenzy = Multi hit moves, DoT, Poisons, Absorb % damage as

Change delivery mechanism of skill:
-> Path of Exile has ability to change delivery mechanism of skill into totem/mines.
-> We can do something similar with weapon inserted into creature's weapon space.

Creatures states in combat
-> Channeled State (involved in a multi-turn skill)

Dual Wielding similar to PoE:
-> Innate bonuses (slight defense, massive offense like 10% more attack speed)
-> Alternates between both if a hit occurs (alternates per attack rate meaning you can apply a set of damage effects in one and a set of effects in the other).


Perhaps terminology andf thinking of Item level and mod pools work differently.
Instead, items have 2 attributes to item level. Base Level and No. of Transistors (similar to Nanometer level) which influences number and efficacy of mods.

Relationships (Different ways to solve the puzzle)
5 Attributes
Authority, Order, Invictus, Animus, M.Y.T.H
Each has a bucket of damage types associated
Authority => Martial/
Order => Elemental/
Invictus => Elemental/
Animus => Umbral/Spectral
M.Y.T.H => All of the above (affects specific parts of each attribute).

Wizard of Legends 2 (Game) -> interesting for our game.

Perhaps a Domination like game mode with specific crafing mechanics
-> https://youtu.be/ddAYex6MonM?t=69

Skill Mechanics
-> Operators that have specific effects
-> Coupling Supports and Spells or specific effects and a main skill matrix that can be gathered from loot.
->https://youtu.be/ddAYex6MonM?t=150

Different systems of levelling/tiering naming schemes
-> Tier 15/16/17
-> Risk: Dragon/ExtraDimensional
-> Compiler: Origin/Genesis/Lovorna (The processor that adds specific additions to the map)

-> Critical crafting that can be beneficial to Xen and other users.

-> Rulesets

-> Creature resources for cost on moves (Stamina (Memory Alloc), Life, Mana (Bandwidth), Shields (Momentum, Convergence, Energy, Chrysalis), 
--> https://youtu.be/Ka0azILd7Ek?t=1630

Quad-trees
-> Represent in 2D space for less collision checks.

Possession from Wisps would be cool for extra mods

Channelling skills take multiple turns to resolve
-> Can activate cast on channeling
-> 25% all damage mitigation whilst channelling
-> Cannot use other skills during turn lock out.

Additional collectibles that are particularly high quality
When we sell copies as an established studios, I would love to include physical copies that help to have people immerse themselves in the Shattered Realms, like Diablo 2 did for their game.
-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ox4p8pNeX4

Glitch instead of corruption.
-> 2 types of glitches
-> Can have max of 3 glitches on any entity with seperate modpools.

Ascendency pipeline routes

What problems do we want the player to solve
-> No mana potions in Diablo 2 (Leagues could have themes around this answer with subliminal understanding later about how to fill this void. Perhaps the major puzzle to solve in the league)
-> Backgrounds in the game should immerse the player in the world. Tealish general primary colour with a new world feeling. Zones like Delve, Blight is the general theming and it should feel Mythically engineering with degraded ruined stuff.

Non-innate modpool modifiers listed on item should be highlighted with specific design showcasing modpool it is influenced from.

Xen's country takes inspiration of how to manifest help in accessible ways, responsibility of services both by consumers and general public and methodology that retains only those that are willing to operate specificaly with the country while minimizing issues.

- Connor's way of thinking about moves should be used for overall move design (Molten Zenith Energy Blade)
-> Damage Effectiveness per second (per turn/hit/attack rate)
-> We will provide damage effectiveness of skill based on a couple of factors and build mathematical models that helps to provide us with a general understanding of the moves we release into the game and their potential (with room for exploration).
-> Dual Strike -> SpellBlade support
-> Scaling vectors that can help this:
--> Stat Stacker, Crit, Mana Stacker (Bandwidth stacking w/ a Unique mod or Grid mod that specifically turns resource into more damage (more % scaling)), Attack Speed/Attack Rate, etc...

-> One of the early endgame activities we will add is an infinite Delve inspired game mode but with interesting decisions made.

-> Really cool endgame activity
-> Harvest with Chemistry based additions
--> Refinement of material by beating boss that drops a specific item that acts like a centrifuge (or a UI opens after beating a boss that can apply a centrigual pressure to an core of item (like refining Uranium-235 -> Uranium-238)
-> Take item to compiler colosseum to double/triple glitch.

Timeless Jewels Inspired items
-> Lovelace Rhapsody
-> Babbage Swansong
-> Turing Melancholy
-> Edmin Lannister

Move Module
-> Conversion threshold to gain tag
--> If majority conversion of damage from a physical move to a specific damage type is achieved

Technician Grid/Cipher Network
-> 

Move Configuration
-> Move Designer (Maximum Bandwidth memory <1GB>). Each type of renovation to the skill (modules, etc..) lowers memory. Modules can cause interesting renovations to the skill.
-> Olexa (youtube) (coding+roguelike)

DEFCON endgame activitiy
-> Some cool stuff here that we can do. Perhaps its PvP.
-> Cryptography/Encryption endgame related content similar to Harvest regard expanse and underpinning within crafting and atlas crafting. For example it might be that specific blueprints are encrypted and the goal during the run is to scramble it before the boss to x1.5 loot.

Scarabs => APIs (Augmented Proliferation ISOs)

As player goes through campaign
-> Area Level Increases
-> Spawned creatures with implicits that and implicit mod pool increases
-> Gear/Items/Grid Elements increase overall regarding quality, etc...
-> 

Rolling Maps 
-> Build your stack equivalent (Framework stacking vs Protocol stacking vs Function Stacking)

Crafting Ops:
-> Instead of taking away from an existing craft, instead crafting operations build up a value of tempering/tolerance that causes additional crafting to become more expensive. I am thinking of moving this through tiers to the point where engaging in more crafting of the item might just become a frightening prospect. This could be a better way to handle crafts as it allows more farming to working on the same craft until a threshold where there is no point.

Positive/Negative GL!TCH
-> Replaces Corruption in PoE with an similar but slightly different interpretation where items can be positively glitched or negatively. 
-> Potentially allows for specfic crafting interactions particularly in late game crafting sequences where perhaps POSITIVEly glitched weapons can be reverted back to a normal status whereas NEGATIVEly glitched weapons cannot revert back but can add specific functions (think an interesting crucible dynamic) typically used to close an crafting sequence.


Endgame Activity
-> Transfer Window (interesting concept between trade)

Levelling
-> Same -isms as PoE with: 
--> experience penalty to slow down growth
--> death causing experience loss
--> hardcore mode
--> levelling cap is 124 (1(0)24) would be a symbol for gigibytes)
--> experience inclimbs particularly after 100 (soft cap)

Tier of Cipher Blueprints
-> Tier 10 and above encompass completing sets of maps for more rewards
-> Rolling blueprints is more common than rolling individual maps
--> Extra juicing with additional APIs

-> APIs replace scarabs (max 8)
-> Extra leagues will add middleware that can affect this
-> Interesting interactions and relationships with isolated endgame activities (Blight/Heist/etc...)

Archetypal Gear/Gems/Items/Creatures
-> Kalandra
-> Doedre
-> Doryani 
--> Can play into internal narrative about history of the world.

PoE's influences system => Mythoras Lineage system (traditional lineage combined with old to new programming frameworks)

PoE's maps
-> Can add multiple maps with the middle being the primary such that a player can add more ... (currency, scarabs, maps) to the game in a way that is...
-> Might make this a Cipher Network keystone node that players path to in order to improve it.

Action vs Passive parts of skills
-> Vaal gems (Active vs Passive) with CD

-> Technician Aura modifiers affect team stats like a hero in League of Runeterra or One Piece TCGs

-> Kingdra creature inspiration
--> Whirlpool like design, sniper oriented, benefits from single target moves moreso with mod pool.

-> After Monster Level 84, branches open given specific domains that control type of creature/technician framework and loot dropped. Also they now include a level that stretches up to 8

--> become a part of the intelligence service (battling team rocket, team magma, team aqua)

-> One of the different Tier 17s that we could employ instead of just a really hard map is to allow players to create an Blueprint Array or a Cipher Sequence that allows a player to create a multi-map array such that they can amass mods (randomly selected) up until the final map in the array that is defined by the blueprint container and the boss controlled by a specific framework drops loot. There is also a gamble feature to elevate risk and the expense of losing all loot accrued up until that point.

-> Good breakdown of experiences in aRPGs. Perhaps instead of items, players are building systems that can be incrementally or entirely swapped out.

Compatibility with Live Splits
-> txt file containing specific tournaments.)

Could have some cool story telling things
-> https://youtu.be/8DCl2iGkQHQ?t=1100
-> Player has little attributes but you can develop organic rivalries with other Technicians and Engineers combining into the aRPG framework.

Essence
-> Essence => Chyrsalis
--> Diamond Chrysalis

Artists to consider:
-> Leoruiga (Instagram)

Melvor Idle
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1267910/Melvor_Idle/?curator_clanid=38846493

Tiers of skill gems
-> Initiate
-> Divine
-> Exceptional
-> Unique

-> Alva Temple + Sanctum Roguelike with each environment providing crafting/gambling opportunities up to the top.

-> Shrines impact the Technician (players) and provide team-wide buffs and utility.

-> Cluster Jewel like entities that we use allow for easier switching of configuration before a battle. (Perhaps player is aware of 

-> Gengar inspired mythic
--> Wispy ghost like base form yet to mature. A sort of hybrid between abra and haunter. Divinities (Ascension/Evolution) revolve around mature forms of ghost like creatures (Gengar, Froslass, New form of ghost warrior)
-> Null Maps (Void Modifier on the highest tier of map in PoE that will x5 top loot but if you die, the account is completely voided)

-> Market to trade muelled (levelled skill moves) that can be sold as a part of the economy.

-> Recombinate Uniques
--> Obtain specific modifiers at the expense of losing both or returning it to rare quality (potential to develop a rare with both unique modifiers).

--> Could have the UI presentation for big matches (and championship final matches to win the league) be really highly presentable with potential UI esque cutscenes.
https://youtu.be/Zlch7ax68AI?list=TLPQMTAwODIwMjWc9ZVZm5mw8g&t=8

-> Integrate a Hall of Grandmasters PoE inspired Hall of Fame for the most interesting teams. We can open this up to a fan vote and have exclusive drops if players are capable of beating these teams. Might team up with the players who created these builds in order to design a custom AI for how they would choose abilities.
--> https://youtu.be/I4yr_hZd6Bo?list=TLPQMTEwODIwMjVpgq3599QPrA&t=104

-> Interesting weapon and accessory bases 
--> An order based weapn base where the top gets a 100% increase magnitude of effect while the lowest gets -50% magnitude. Could be that this occurs across pool so to maximize at 100% it has to be a full mod item.

-> Must have the iconic cyclone

-> Ecosystem based idea for endgame
--> Monsters adapt to player's build over time and build resistance along with other stat reductions against the skill (or it could be community oriented.)

-> Status symbol to obtain a mageblood like unique that is capable of making so many builds defensively and utility wise unbelievably good.#

-> Otherworld Tournament Map (Conquest)
--> Inspired by Valdo T17 Maps. Competition gauntlet maps against the Incarnates who are Technicians who have raised their creatures beyond the traditional scope (Think Red/Blue/Gary/Lance/Cynthia) These teams are highly challenge oriented but beget a highly prized unique item (with additional loot) for coming in 1st place. 2nd and 3rd receive multipliers on certain loot.

-> Legendary creatures on Cipher Network Map
--> https://youtu.be/9OgpntleYJ0?t=969
---> To get to a specific legendary encounter, you will require going through one of the associated map nodes in order to uncover the related creature's key/token/hint to unlock it.

-> First League
--> Atlantis (Xenith's Return)

Regional Atlas
-> https://youtu.be/2fNfgpizWck?t=1980
--> Atlas grid like that can reset

-> Might not require each domain having a damage type. Might be able to have utility damage types, physical/spell split with augments via damage type or damage types that serve to have limited overall damage impact but gear towards other damage capabilities. For example, Tidal can be an interesting merger domain where it's Wet Ailment is unique to obtain but can create interesting scenarios. It can multiply with Shock effect for maximum endgame potential spike damage (or naturally make lightning damage lucky), it can create steam when used with ignite ailment causing burn scenarios and reducing healing and cause encumber effect and finally it can work with sediments to form a unique damage type (could be an interesting variant effect) that augments the Tidal Damage type with extra damage.

-> Mark/Curses could directly apply certain ailments once the threshold is met and then we can evolve into our game for specific setup type moves.

Skills Moves (TMs) early:
-> Lightning
--> Lightning Transformer (Low Voltage)
--> Voltaic Shock

-> Infernal
--> Smoulder
--> StokeSmoke

-> Tidal (Utility)
--> ScatterSoak
--> Frost Breath
--> Wave
--> 

Ascendies can be called Substratas or Stratas
-> Interesting name

Creature limit can be 4 for now and domained to a specific part of the passive tree in a position governed by the player/
-> Solo and Doubles on battle field for now.

-> Name for Creature based on Brigadier

-> Main way to craft will be through mod group crafting

Buffs and Debuffs
-> Voltaic Buff -> increases damage delivery by 15%
-> Shock -> applies a 10% damage debuff that can be increased with threshold penetration
-> Static -> applies a weaker shock damage debuff but potential chance to paralyze target.
-> Resonant Shock (M.Y.T.H) -> applies debuff that slows user's priority next turn and doubles shock threshold penetration.

Arsenal 
-> Bomb like cast on crit meta gem
--> Meta jewels allow for interesting delivery mechanisms (should create for spells and attacks

Combo
-> Inspired by Quarterstaff combo in PoE
--> Certain combos can be accessed and play w/ specific other mechanics.
--> For example, we can have Resonance be a combo for Elemental based damage types, Virilism for creating stronger poisons, Tempo for Martial oriented Origins and something like Leadership for Authority and Primal oriented Origins. 
--> This then translates to interesting play with M.Y.T.H and specific ailments (potentially creating new ones) Like Resonance during battle could allow for a creature's soak attacks to do more damage ...

Toolkit 
-> Omen like objects that can be sourced as a basic drop that provide meaningful coverage for specific things that can be used (Omen of Amelioriation)

Workshop Tab Area

Instead of using Prefixes/Suffixes, we could instead have a system that potentially uses a Matrix like Quadratic system for modifiers. Gear may potentially be unlocked as item and gear progresses up the hierarchy with the best bases in the game having interesting systems. Crafting would have to support something like this. Onboarding is important but it is an interesting way to manipulate modifiers inspired but different to the Orbs in Path of Exile.

-> Interesting ability modifiers like Intimidate and Defiance

-> Hardcore Nuzlocke

-> Async Trade/Better breeding system (likie weapons in poE)

-> Instead of Evolutionary lines we call them Ancestral Lines

-> Faction Families for Support Maccinations, Move Maccination (Tulus => Turing, Lazalove -> Lovelace, Barbola -> Babbage)
--> Allow for different Factions in this world to create harmonies with different game systems.

-> Make creature profiles flexible (instead of distinct profiles, make them offshoots of the main profile like weapon sets, etc...)

-> Gear Families
--> Similar to Faction Families, Weapons and Gear might be pooled into a category and access implicits from their part of the weapon family as opposed to a set of bases. This might need be limited but could solve later game crafting on specific bases. 

-> Risk based juicing of endgame content

-> Crafting in Mythoras might be more akin to building out an expression to perform something using the mystical powers of agents. Agents allow for two expressive outcomes with rarer agents causing more interesting dynamics in crafting. Crafting is about mathematical expressions to shape manipulations of modifiers (perhaps).
