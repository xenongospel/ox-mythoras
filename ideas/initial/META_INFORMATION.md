## Section 1 â€“ Consolidated Game Design - High Level Concept

Mythoras is a multi-player (offer solo self found, private server initialization and larger league oriented server infrastructure) depthful, creatureâ€‘collecting tactical action RPG that mixes the buildâ€‘crafting/theory-crafting and loot depth of Path of Exile with the strategic creature battling structure of PokÃ©mon and the management aesthetic of Football Manager. 
Players (called Technicians) explore a wide open world, collect and configure Creatures, assemble teams and fight in grid-based, tactical battles.
The game emphasizes **strategic complexity**, **high player agency**, and **emergent gameplay depth** through a series of engaging game systems drawing and improving on systems from Pokemon such as elements of strategy through type system  and overall team composition combining them with the endless customization and configuration of Path of Exile particularly with a Technician oriented shared creature passive tree, configurable moves and utility to make them work in new and interesting ways and finally a dedicated endgame that allows for multiple hours of gameplay to truly become the best in the world.

**Improvements from Pokemon (inspired by Path of Exile)**
- No Endgame or difficulty modes that allow for greater skill expression
    - Elite Four is the only hard content and even then it is not very tough both regarding time or complexity even with little planning. The base game is unsatisfactory and there are only so many moddable ways to make it compelling. 
    - Nuzlocke is fun but externally supported meaning that the player has to conform to the rules which can be easy to forget or hard to enforce on yourself.
    - Path of Exile's entire league structure exists to get players to enjoy a large progression journey after completing the campaign. Players are thrust into an interesting story that they can choose to interact with or not and involve themselves in various different endgame activities that can be scaled through an Atlas Progression Tree where points are accumulated through completing specific Map Zones that are categorized between Tier 1 to 16. During this time, they face an assortment of specific bosses that upon slaying them provide a Voidstone increasing the potency of the player's atlas and allowing them to engage in specific strategies to farm currency which is a really fun part of the trade league economy acting almost like real-life economic activity. Players can choose to engage in various different ways to accumulate the currency and even craft for profit by selling to other players. This is what I want to achieve for Mythoras.
- No other elements to control for player apart from creature collecting and general training patterns.
    - Pokemon has a fundamental lack of action RPG elements that allow for players to meaningfully make decisions. Most of the game can be telegraphed given a highly limited AI controlling most opponent decisions and in PvP, while fun, there is a limit to accruing advantages and one wrong decision causing the end of a battle. Path of Exile is the best game in the world at providing meaningful and satisfactory depth such that battles continually mean something, loot is obtained, gear drops and crafting can make the character you play stronger (meaningful progression) and there is a varied and large volume of content in ranging difficuly (that the player can make harder in order to be rewarded more) that allows for a different set of builds to exist targeting specific content. Pokemon does not have this AT ALL. 
    - There are many scenarios I can envision where creating multiple teams and completing the campaign of Pokemon (8 badges to the Elite Four on a shared account) could allow the player to specifically create teams for specific purposes. Perhaps it can be made hard to change creatures fluidly in a team given the commitment and so players are encouraged to go through the campaign again using a specific decision (In Path of Exile, this is typically through the character archetype - Shadow vs Witch vs Duelist or even Ascendencies on the same archetype like creating a dedicated Trickster and Saboteur on different characters within a single account). This is what I want to achieve.
    -> Pokemon usually have useless 2nd evolutions
        - Instead, Mythoras creatures will have the ability to evolve into a specific evolutionary form with designs that feel more like Mega Evolutions but permanent. These are similar to Path of Exie's ascendencies.
- **Build Permutations and Theorycrafting:** The attribute system is designed to support **complex build permutations**. Players can mix and match attribute focuses to unlock synergy. A single creature might scale from multiple sources â€“ e.g., a mage creature with high Animus for damage might also invest in Authority to extend buffs and *bandwidth stacking* synergy. In Mythoras, we ensure that attributes have interplay. For example, a high Animus build might utilize a special affix that increases damage based on max bandwidth (similar to PoEâ€™s Archmage Support gem, which grants bonus damage based on bandwidth spent ([Archmage Support - Path of Exile Wiki](https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage_Support#:~:text=Archmage%20Support%20is%20a%20support,spent%20to%20cast%20that%20skill))). Another build might stack Order and Authority to become an unmovable support that bolsters allies each turn. There are **soft caps** on extreme scaling achieved via *opportunity cost*: investing heavily in one attribute yields diminishing returns in that you forgo benefits of others. This keeps the late-game balanced â€“ you can push a single stat very high, but youâ€™ll feel the trade-off. However, through clever use of the unique mechanics above (inversions, conversions), players can circumvent some limits and achieve *late-game scaling* that breaks the usual caps, at the cost of complexity or risk. The design goal is to make sure no single build path trivializes content â€“ there should always be a way to counter or a drawback to manage â€“ but also to allow players to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with ingenious combinations.

  **Attributes & Foundry system**
  - **Core Attributes**:
  -> Define creature's general orientation
  -> Influence a Technicianâ€™s build framework
  -> These attributes are not mere stat sticks â€“ they are deeply integrated into combat calculations, skill interactions, and progression systems. 
  There are four primary attributes and a potential fifth wildcard:  
    -> **Authority:** Represents Strength. Inspired from a typical aRPG attribute called Strength increases minimum and maximum generic base damage by .1% and defensively applies .5% damage mitigation (perhaps Armour but haven't properly defined defensive layer although I would prefer not necessarily repeating what Path of Exile does.)  
    -> **Order:** Represents the inordinate Mystic Intelligence within Strength. Inspired by Templar from Path of Exile. Embodies discipline, structure, and defensive prowess. Inspired from an innovation of a typical aRPG attribute called Intelligence, Order increases overall bandwidth by 2 increasing overall skill capacity offensively while defensively, it increases overall max health by 1%. This might be subject to change but this attribute increases overall endurance both in skill and defensive resources.  
    -> **Invictus:** Represents Dexterity and Precision within Strength. Inspired by Duelist from Path of Exile, Characters like Kha'zix, Rengar and Martial like characters like Lucario and Gallade. It plays more towards a primal and intrusive type of playstyle scaling offensive presence potentially in physical or magic depending on the creature. Invictus-heavy creatures are particularly nimble and effective in the hunt. Can lean Authority or Animus.
    -> **Animus:** Represents Intelligence and Mystical Arts. Supernatural and wondering elements. Inspired from an innovation of Intelligence (for that uses an inspired *Spell* tag moves), along with unorthodox and potentially interesting dynamics that makes animus key for creatures inspired by Pokemon like Gengar, Alakazam, Orianna and Azir (from League of Legends) as mages and supernatural beings. Highly offensive and typically links to Invictus to provide greater augmentation of speed and defence through evasiveness.
    -> **M.Y.T.H.:** A tentative fifth attribute acting as a wildcard keystone stat. â€œMYTHâ€ stands for a mythical keystone that doesnâ€™t linearly scale like the others. Investing in M.Y.T.H. might offer unique bonuses or rule-bending effects that defy normal limits in exchange for consistent growth. For instance, it might allow a creature to partially ignore attribute requirements, while amplifying the highest stat at the cost of the lowest (a form of *inversion*). M.Y.T.H. is about **wildcard power** â€“ high-risk, high-reward â€“ enabling creative build paths that conventional stats cannot. Typically low investment in most builds up until late endgame where other game mechanics can allow for specific investment into this stat for specific purposes.  

**Foundry Imprinting:** 
- Like PoEâ€™s item randomisation, each creature spawns with RNG layers of â€œFoundry Imprintsâ€ (Implicit Affixes). These will have a profound effect on their Imprint Affix Ability (chosen from a base modpool influenced by Domain and Origin.) and other potential attributes although slightly.  
- Imprints are permanent to force players to have to find the specific creature alignment they require before building them if they want to minmax their build. This will typically occur late game. These are hard to re-roll though may not be impossible in the endgame through a specific quest or boss drop. 

**Foundry Sub-stats** 
- Each attribute has a suite of **Foundry Sub-stats** derived from it. For example, Invictus might yield sub-stats like *Power* (physical damage), *Precision* (Accuracy Stacker), and *Animate* (Spell Damage/Defensive Hybrid) and *Assault* (Physical damage vector with more emphasis on power). Animus could split into *Max Bandwidth and Bandwidth Regen*, *Arcana*, *Utilitarian* and *Affinity* (spell intensity). 
- These sub-stats allow fine-tuning: players can decide whether an Invictus-based creature focuses on raw damage or survivability, etc. 
- The â€œFoundryâ€ concept implies that core attributes *forge* these secondary stats; as a creatureâ€™s attributes grow, the sub-stats scale accordingly, and players can allocate training or gear to emphasize one sub-stat over another.

**Origins and Domains**  
- Every creature in Mythoras: Shattered Realms is defined by two fundamental aspects of its being: its **Origin** and its **Domain**. These together replace the traditional â€œtypeâ€ system seen in PokÃ©mon, providing a more nuanced and flexible framework for creature identity, strengths, and weaknesses. Origins and Domains influence a creatureâ€™s stats, move pools, and interactions, creating a dual-classification that allows for rich variety and strategic matchups.
- **Origins â€“ Mythic Identity:** An Origin represents the inherent nature or lineage of a creature â€“ essentially its **mythological archetype or existential source**. Itâ€™s like a "race" or "background" that comes with innate qualities. There are currently 8 potential designs for Origins in Mythoras (final number may vary, but weâ€™ll use these for design):
1. **Avatar:** These creatures are incarnations of greater powers or deities. They have a balanced aspect but often come with special abilities representing their divine spark. Avatars tend to have high Authority (leadership, presence) and often influence allies or the battlefield itself. *Example:* A phoenix that represents rebirth (Avatar Origin might grant it an innate revival ability once per battle). Avatars might synergize with multiple Domains since they channel broad mythic forces.  
2. **Scalesbourne:** Creatures of draconic or reptilian lineage. They are typically tough and aggressive. Likely high Invictus (strength) and decent Order (natural Armour â€“ â€œscalesâ€ often imply physical defense). Scalesbourne might have innate elemental breaths (depending on Domain) and are often prime candidates for frontline roles. *Example:* A dragon whelp or a basilisk â€“ scaly creatures with fierce offense. Origin trait might be â€œScaled Hideâ€ (built-in damage reduction).  
3. **Psybourne:** Psychic or psionic creatures, born of mental or spiritual energy. They lean toward Animus (and Authority for mind domination). Psybourne creatures excel at mind-affecting moves, illusions, and telekinetic powers. They might naturally resist mental ailments and have lower physical stats. *Example:* A telepathic owl or a dream-eater spirit. Origin trait: â€œThird Eyeâ€ (increased chance to crit with mental attacks or innate prediction of enemy moves).  
4. **Martial:** Creatures that are naturally adept in physical combat or have a warrior spirit. Could include humanoid fighters, golems, or beastly fighters. High Invictus and Order; straightforward in role â€“ damage dealers or tanks. They may not wield magic but often have techniques (like weapon mastery or chi). *Example:* A golem knight or a tiger with martial training. Origin trait: â€œCombat Disciplineâ€ (increased effectiveness of physical moves, or an extra minor action for physical attacks, etc.).  
... and more

Each Origin comes with inherent **advantages and disadvantages**:
- **Stat Tendencies:** Origin affects base stat growth or starting stats for each individual creature species. E.g., Martial and Scalesbourne give more physical stats, Mystique and Psybourne give more mana and magic, etc. Origins will typically align with an attribute or attribute hybrid (Martial would be a hybrid of Invictus and Authority or Order, compared to Mystique being Order/Animus).
- **Origin Minimal Affinities:** Origins can have a rock-paper-scissors relationship too, but more asymmetrical similar to PokÃ©mon. For instance, *Nocturne* creatures (undead/shadow) might be naturally strong against *Psybourne* (mind) because mind attacks donâ€™t affect the soulless undead as well, but weak against *Mystique* (pure magic might unravel undead) and others. *Martial* might overpower *Mystique* (brute force vs frail wizard) and *Aggregator* (mechanical vs organic) but struggle against *Scalesbourne* (dragons outmuscle human fighters). We create a chart of Origin interactions that is flavorful and not strictly symmetric â€“ e.g., an Origin might have one it dominates, one it is weak to, and a couple neutral or mixed interactions.
- **Origin Abilities:** Every Origin might grant a small passive or an active ability unique to it. For example, all Avatars have â€œInspireâ€ (slight buff to alliesâ€™ main stat), all Primal have â€œEnrageâ€ (when HP falls low, boost attack), etc. This makes Origin immediately impactful beyond stats.

**Domains â€“ Classification (Damage Type) Role:** 
-If Origin is the â€œwhat you areâ€, Domain is â€œwhat you wield or embodyâ€ â€“ similar to PokÃ©mon types but expanded and more flexible. Each usually tied to an fundamental entity or force, with their own effectiveness relationships. Each creature has exactly one/two Domains.

Examples of potential Domains (inspired by but not identical to Pokemon types, to extend depth):
- **Infernal** (infernal) (Like) â€“ offensive, burn-focused.
- **Tidal** (tidal) (Don't mind) â€“ adaptive, fluid, some healing or buff cleansing maybe.
- **Tectonic** (Earth) â€“ defensive, uses tectonic and ground/rock, fortification.
- **Voltaic** (Electric) â€“ high burst, shock, technical effects.
- and more...

**Team Composition Consideration:** 
Players will likely want a spread of Domains to cover different enemy weaknesses in League play (just like PokÃ©mon trainers carry a variety). Theyâ€™ll also consider Origins for more blanket effects â€“ e.g., having at least one Avatar or Mystique origin might be useful because they have support abilities that help the team universally. Perhaps an Aggregator origin creature can be a wildcard since it might adapt.

**Origin & Domain Progression:** 
- Creatures do not change Origin (except possibly via special Transformation keystones or story events â€“ extremely rare). Origin is core to identity.
- Domain might be static as well per creature species. We could consider that *some creatures can change Domain* as a form of evolution or variant. But that might be handled instead by variant system or Pinnacle Evolutions (like a creature evolves and changes its domain, e.g., a certain creature could be infernal initially and â€œascendâ€ to Infernal/Tectonic dual nature, or just change to Tectonic).
- We may allow one creature to have access to a secondary Domain moveset through heavy investment (like a Tidal creature learning some ice moves if you invest in Glacial passives). But its inherent Domain is still one for the purpose of weakness/resistance.

**Environmental Domain Effects:** Possibly, environment (battlefield terrain) could have domain effects (like fighting in a Volcano amplifies Infernal moves, weakens Glacial, etc.). This ties into a living world aspect and competitive arenas might have these as modifiers.

In summary, **Origins and Domains** together create a two-dimensional classification for every creature which drives their progression and combat role. Origins give broad identity and unique mechanics, while Domains determine elemental attributes and tactical advantages. This system is designed to ensure that no single factor (like just a type advantage) guarantees victory â€“ players must consider both layers. It also provides **extensive world-building opportunities**: each Origin has lore in the world (e.g., how Avatars are revered or how Aggregators are created), and Domains tie to the elemental Realms that are shattered (hence the title *Shattered Realms*). This reinforces a cohesive integration of story and mechanics, enriching the gameplay experience.

**Creature Design and Progression**  
- Creatures are the heart of Mythoras, and their design philosophy is â€œevery creature is endgame-viable with the right buildâ€. Unlike some RPGs where early monsters become obsolete, Mythoras ensures that even a humble base creature can be developed into a formidable ally through smart investment and progression choices. Creature progression is flexible and rich, emphasizing *build diversity*, *personalization*, and avoiding tedious or opaque grinding systems.

**Base Species Viability:** From the outset, each species (base creature form) is designed with a unique combination of Attributes, Origin/Domain, and potential moves that give it a niche or multiple possible roles. This means:
- Stat scaling curves for each creature are balanced so that a weaker early-game creature might have, for example, cheaper passive tree navigation or unique affixes to catch up later. A late-game catch might have higher base stats but maybe less flexibility.
- *Leveling:* Creatures do gain experience and levels (which could increase their core stats moderately and sometimes learn new moves), but a level 50 early-route creature and a level 50 rare creature should be in the same ballpark of power if built well, just with different strengths. The difference is in how you utilize their inherent traits (via passive tree, affixes, etc.).

**Attribute Tendencies and Starting Tree Positions:** 
- Each species has **attribute tendencies** â€“ e.g., one species might naturally lean towards high Animus and low Invictus, etc. This determines their starting stat distribution and how they gain stats per level. It doesnâ€™t lock them out of other builds, but indicates their forte. Additionally, species have a **starting position on the Motherboard Passive Tree** ([Passive skill - Path of Exile Wiki](https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/Passive_skill#:~:text=Every%20character%20in%20Path%20of,character%27s%20passive%20%27path%27%20is%20formed)). For example:
- This gives them a head-start in their specialty (fewer points needed to get those key nodes) but they can traverse elsewhere if you want to off-build them.

**Pinnacle Evolution (Ascension):** 
- We forego the traditional multi-stage evolution (like evolving at certain levels into a strictly better form). Instead, each creature has a potential **Pinnacle Evolution**, which is more akin to an *Ascendancy or Mega-Evolution* reached through significant effort or specific conditions. It is a one-time transformation that **permanently augments the creature** rather than replacing it with an entirely different one.
- Mechanically, a Pinnacle Evolution might be tied to achieving something: reaching a certain level and completing a special quest or allocating a particular transformation node on the passive tree (discussed earlier). It might require a rare item or winning a certain championship.
- When executed, the creature might gain a new title or form (like adding a prefix â€œAscendedâ€ or some unique name change). Its appearance could change (like a cosmetic upgrade or aura).
- Stat-wise, Pinnacle Evolution provides a notable boost (similar to what an evolution would, like a big stat jump) and possibly unlocks new move or passive ability unique to this ascended form. It could also unlock an additional implicit affix slot or an extra passive tree branch unique to that species.
- Example: A base creature â€œVulpixâ€ might have a Pinnacle Evolution â€œNinetales". Achieving that might multiply its Animus and Invictus, give it a fiery aura ability, and maybe change its Domain from Infernal to Infernal/Glacial hybrid (or just a stronger Infernal).
- Pinnacle evolutions are meant to be exciting late-game goals, often equivalent in power boost to what multiple normal evolutions would have been, but without needing to evolve 2-3 times. This also means you donâ€™t have to wait to use a â€œfully evolvedâ€ monster â€“ you use your base form all game, and then it evolves once when youâ€™re ready, so youâ€™re attached to it.

**Build Diversity through Variant Forms and Target Farming:** 
- To keep things interesting, many creatures have **variants** â€“ sub-species or alternate forms that can be found or bred (though we avoid random breeding mechanics, itâ€™s more through environment or method of encounter):
- **Variant Examples:** A creature species â€œTidalclawâ€ might have a variant â€œGlacialclawâ€ if encountered in a cold climate realm â€“ same base creature but with a different Domain (tidal vs glacial) and different implicit mod. Or a â€œMechadroneâ€ creature might have variants depending on what faction influenced it (similar to PoEâ€™s influenced items) giving it slight move set differences.
- Variants often come with unique **implicit affixes** or altered stat emphases. Maybe Frostclaw has an implicit â€œIcy Claws: chance to Chill on hitâ€ whereas normal Aquaclaw has â€œtidal Veil: small regen in rainâ€.
- These variants are not strictly stronger; they are lateral options to adapt your creature to a different build or team need. You might seek out a particular variant because its implicit suits a combo you want (this is target farming).

**No Time-Gated Training / No EV or IV:** 
- We explicitly avoid hidden grind stats
- **No IVs (Individual Values):** In PokÃ©mon, each monster has random hidden stats requiring catching multiples to get a good one. In Mythoras, any randomness can be solved by obtaining endgame related items that operates like a Divine Orb for creatures which can be target farmed giving agency. In addition, a combination of attributes and the Foundry Imprint affix system (which can be altered later in the endgame) can help to create a better scenario for creature optimization. So you donâ€™t need to catch 50 of the same creature to get â€œone with good statsâ€ â€“ you catch one, and if you want to customize it, you modify it through the explicit systems. This makes each catch valuable and reduces frustration.
- **No EVs (Effort Values):** Training in PokÃ©mon through battling certain enemies to increase specific stats is opaque and grindy. In Mythoras, stat customizations come from where you allocate passive points and what affixes you give. Itâ€™s a conscious, visible process rather than hidden accumulation. You wonâ€™t have to e.g. defeat 100 bats to raise your speed; youâ€™d instead maybe equip a speed affix or invest in a speed node. So *opportunity cost* rather than *time spent grinding* is the balancing factor.
- **No move mastery via grinding:** Some games have moves get stronger the more you use them. We avoid requiring repetitive usage to unlock move potential or improved accuracy, etc. If moves can be improved, itâ€™s via items or leveling up in a straightforward way. We want players to use moves because they are the right tactical choice, not to train them.

**Growth and Soft Caps:** 
- As creatures level up, their stat gains will naturally slow down approaching a soft cap (to prevent extreme inflation), these are very minor. The more important growth is complemented by the attributes, the shared passive tree and affixes. 
- So leveling alone doesnâ€™t make you all-powerful; it gives baseline improvements and access to more moves, but real power comes from synergies of your build. 
- A level 60 creature with poor build could be beaten by a level 50 with an excellent build and gear â€“ similar to how in ARPGs a lower-level but well-geared character can take on higher content.

**Implicit Affixes (Foundry Implicits) and Unique Pools:** 
- Every creature species (and variant) carries one or more **implicit affixes** by default, as mentioned earlier. This makes them distinct beyond just attributes. For example:
- Species: **Rocafeller** (Martial/Earth type) might have implicit â€œTough Hide: 5% physical damage reductionâ€.
- Species: **Alicizer** (Mystique/Air, a floating jellyfish) implicit â€œAerial: evades tectonic moves entirelyâ€ (like a flying property). Variant **Cellizer** implicit â€œCharged: small chance to static shock melee attackersâ€.
- These implicit mods mean when youâ€™re choosing creatures, you consider these traits. They function similarly to PokÃ©mon abilities, but we can have more than one per creature via affixes. Some creatures might have two implicits if theyâ€™re special (like a legendary might have multiple).
- Importantly, these implicit pools are unique per species â€“ meaning the possible implicit an affix could have is drawn from a limited set, not random out of all creatures. This ensures thematic consistency. 

**No Artificial Gating:** 
- We avoid mechanics like â€œhappinessâ€ or â€œtime of day evolutionâ€ that force waiting or arbitrary conditions. Any special evolution or unlock (like Pinnacle Evolution, or unlocking a variant) is tied to meaningful gameplay actions (winning a tournament, using a rare item from a difficult dungeon, etc.) not real-time waits or grinding friendship. The relationship between you and creatures can be a narrative thing, but we wonâ€™t lock progression behind feeding 100 berries or such.

**Example Progression of a Creature:** 
Take *Ninetales* (Spirit/Infernal) as an example of progression:
- Caught at level 5 with base stats, Foundry Imprint â€œEmber Spirit: +5% burn chanceâ€ picked from a modpool for that species.
- Level up to 20, invest passive points into key nodes that are within the starting area and amplify infernal damage and general speed. Equip it with a custom equipment that has affixes enabling (maybe a collar item with increased Infernal damage and +1 level to all Infernal Skills (along with some useless affixes that were randomly obtained). Then the player begins pathing to a keystone on the passive tree called "Cinderling: Ignite effects deal 5% more damage per stack of Scarredâ€ enabling multiple stages of Ignite to do much more).
- Itâ€™s performing well in mid-game. You find a rare variant in a volcanic area: *Ashentales* variant of the same species which has Foundry Imprint â€œAsh Coat: takes 10% less damage from physical hitsâ€. You decide to convert your Ember Fox into this variant by performing a ritual with volcanic ash (or you catch the Ashen Fox anew and replace, but assuming you want to keep your invested one, maybe a conversion item). Now your fox has better defense.
- Late game, you attempt the Pinnacle Evolution quest: After defeating the Infernal Temple, you obtain the *Foxtales*. Using it on your fox triggers its Ascendent Evolution to *Ifritales Foxlord*. It's Origin remains Mystique, Domain remains Infernal but now it gains a secondary Domain tag Mysticism (just as example for being divine). Base attributes associate to the appropriate Origin and it gains a secondary Foundry Imprint bespoke to the creature â€œIfritâ€™s Presence: nearby enemies have reduced infernal resistanceâ€. In addition, it gains it's own Engine that can be built up similar to a Cluster Jewel replacing or working in tandem the Ascendency Tree in Path of Exile. 
- Now at the end of the campaign, your creatures including Ifrit are endgame ready. It might not have as high raw stats as say a legendary dragon, but it has unique strengths: it heavily amplifies infernal damage for your team.
- You can continue to optimize via endgame crafting: maybe you add a gene mod idol that in conjunction with the motherboard passive tree attempts to increase Infernal Damage scaling through Spell Critical Strike Chance as the main damage dealer.They will then refine gear with perfect affixes for it whilst continuing to play the game.
Throughout this, at no point was the fox â€œuselessâ€ or outclassed â€“ you kept it viable through the systems. Another player might have taken a different base creature and done the same, choosing different paths and arriving at a comparable power through different means.

These design considerations ensure **players can pick creatures they like and make them work**, without feeling forced into only using a handful of â€œmeta strongâ€ monsters. The depth of progression systems means skilled players will squeeze every bit of potential from their favorites. At the same time, those who do chase the rarer or initially stronger creatures will find that they still need to put in effort to maximize them â€“ nothing is a free win, and balance can be adjusted by tuning the passive tree and affix availability for each species. The philosophy is empowerment and personalization: your Mythoras team is truly *yours*, grown and crafted by your choices.

**Damage, Damage Types and Damage Sources**
- **Hit**
--> A hit whether physical, arcane (spell), elemental or another damage classification (similar to Path of Exile) is used to determine the amount of damage a creature takes.
--> Physical (Countered by Armour, Physical Damage Reduction)
--> Arcane (Countered by Armour, Spell Suppression)
--> Elemental (Countered by Resistances - Can be countered by Armour if invested)
--> Other Damage Classification Buckets - (Countered by Resistance and other specific mechanics like Deflect)
- **Accuracy vs Evasion:** Unlike PokÃ©monâ€™s fixed accuracy per move, we might have an accuracy stat vs evasion stat. However, to avoid frustration we could keep base accuracy high (most moves hit unless evasion is stacked or thereâ€™s a specific blind condition). But having accuracy/evasion allows builds around being evasive (e.g., glass cannon that avoids hits instead of tanking them).
- **Damage Types and Tags:** There are many tags (Projectile, Melee, AoE, DoT, etc.) which can influence damage calculation (some defenses might specifically guard vs AoE but not single-target, etc.). For example, a shield might give extra block chance against Projectile attacks, meaning those have a chance to be negated or reduced. If a creature has a trait â€œAgile: 30% evasion against AoE attacksâ€, big AoEs can sometimes miss them.

**Scaling Vectors**
- Ailments
- Critical Strike
- Scaling Attributes imbuing specific mechanics (Strength Stacking in Path of Exile)
- Scaling Resources (Sanctuary of thought - Increases/Decreases to Mana)
- Attribute Stacking
- Scaling: Species base stats are derived from attribute values and distributions like Path of Exile. Players will typically interface with attributes to determine how much damage their creatures will conduct. 
-> Attributes feed into various different game systems similar to Path of Exile. These include the passive tree and other elements inspired by Path of Exile like gear and cluster jewels influencing overall power.

**Creatures**
- **Gear** - Each creature has in-lore custom equipment slots â€“ weapon, offâ€‘hand/tool, armour, accessory and Engine Jewel slots. Gear is randomly generated with affixes (like PoE items) and scales with attributes & Origin/Domain synergy. Certain gear pieces can be socketed with Engine Jewels, granting active moves or passive buffs.
Runtime toolbelt: Each creature equips up to five consumables (analogous to PoEâ€™s flasks). In PoE, flasks are rechargeable potions that consume charges and recover life/mana or grant temporary bonuses
- Mythorasâ€™ consumables may cleanse ailments, grant mobility, or trigger onâ€‘use mechanics. Consumables recharge through combat actions or by visiting safe zones.
- **Creature Level:** Similar to Path of Exile, each zone in the campaign and into the endgame will be associated to a specific creature level which will be the base encounter level for a creature scouted here.
- **Augment scouting:** Pokemon has some hidden mechanics that allows for augmenting the encounter pool of a new creature making it more likely to show up. This could be a fun and interesting way to engage Mythroas. Certain items/equipment/affixes can lead to increasing likelihood of scouting that Pokemon.

**Shared Motherboard Passive Tree**  
At the heart of Mythorasâ€™ progression is the **Motherboard Passive Tree** â€“ a sprawling web of passive enhancements reminiscent of Path of Exileâ€™s famous skill tree, but with a unique twist: it is a **shared, global tree** that all creatures ultimately draw from, yet **each creatureâ€™s path through it is individually chosen**. This system emphasizes strategic team-building, as players plan how each creature will navigate the tree to complement one another.
- **Concept and Inspiration:** The Motherboard tree is inspired by the idea that all your creatures (and the Technician) are connected through a central â€œengineâ€ (the Technicianâ€™s control device, often referred to diegetically as the â€œMotherboardâ€ or Technicianâ€™s Nexus). In Path of Exile, all classes use the same passive tree but start at different points ([Passive skill - Path of Exile Wiki](https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/Passive_skill#:~:text=Every%20character%20in%20Path%20of,character%27s%20passive%20%27path%27%20is%20formed)); similarly, in Mythoras every creature uses the same vast passive grid but has a unique **starting node** based on its species or Origin. This represents the creatureâ€™s natural proclivities (for example, a *Martial* origin creature might start near physical damage and accuracy nodes, whereas a *Mystique* origin creature starts near spell and mana nodes). From there, itâ€™s up to the player to allocate points and chart a path.
- **Earning and Allocating Points:** The Technician (player character) is the one who earns passive points (through leveling up, completing challenges, or perhaps through special items). However, these points are **allocated per creature** rather than into a single universal pool. The lore explanation is that the Technician uses their â€œMotherboardâ€ device to upload routine enhancements to their bonded creatures â€“ essentially, you assign points to creatures of your choice. Each creature has its own passive tree allocation, but all creatures draw from the same tree diagram (so if two creatures path into the same cluster of nodes, theyâ€™ll each have to spend points to get there independently). 
- The Technicianâ€™s *Engine Bond* determines how many points can be allocated to each creature. For instance, initially you might only be able to invest, say, 10 points into any one creature (to prevent dumping all into one and neglecting others), but this limit can increase as the Technician grows stronger or via special upgrades (like items that increase bond capacity). This ensures you develop your team somewhat evenly â€“ a design to prevent one Ã¼ber-creature carrying entirely. However, advanced play could involve intentionally over-investing in one creature for a particular tournament and then respec (with some cost) for another.  
- Points are a finite resource: maybe you have 50 points total and 4 creatures, you decide to allocate 15 to creature A, 15 to B, 15 to C, 5 to D based on roles. If you bench a creature and bring in a new one, you can reallocate those points to the new member (with possibly a small penalty or process, so swapping team comp requires some planning but is not overly punishing).
**Tree Layout:** The Motherboard tree is large and segmented into thematic sections (not unlike PoEâ€™s Strength/Dex/Int sections ([Passive skill - Path of Exile Wiki](https://pathofexile.fandom.com/wiki/Passive_skill#:~:text=The%20character%20classes%20and%20their,starting%20position%20on%20the%20tree))). It contains **nodes** of varying sizes: minor nodes (+stat boosts, like +10% increased Attack (relates to tags) Damage or +5 Animus), **Notables** (larger impactful nodes with unique effects or bigger stat boosts), and **Keystones** (game-changing effects that often come with downsides, e.g., â€œall healing is doubled but happens over 5 seconds, not instantlyâ€ as a hypothetical example). There are also special node types relevant to Mythoras.
- **Masteries:** A 
- **Global Nodes vs Local Nodes:** *Local* nodes affect only the creature that has allocated them (which is the norm â€“ e.g., a node that gives +10% damage will only boost that creatureâ€™s damage). *Global* nodes, however, confer a team-wide benefit if any one creature takes them. For instance, a node might read â€œ**Coordinated Assault**: All your creatures deal 5% increased damage to enemies afflicted by any Ailment.â€ If one of your creatures paths to and takes *Coordinated Assault*, your whole team gets that bonus. These global nodes encourage *specializing roles* (maybe one creature invests in support-oriented global buffs via the tree, effectively becoming a team buffer without using its turn in combat). Generally, global nodes are found around the center or specific branches and might require investment to reach so you canâ€™t have all of them easily. They provide a way to have team synergy beyond type matchups.
- **Transformation Nodes:** In line with the earlier *Transformation* concept, certain keystones on the tree fundamentally alter a creature. For instance, a node might be **â€œMeta-Morphosisâ€**: when allocated, this creature changes its Origin from *Martial* to *Avatar* (lore-wise, transcending its mortal limits) and gains new strengths/weaknesses. Or a keystone like **â€œLichâ€™s Bargainâ€** could transform a creature to an undead-like state: trading some max HP for life leech on attacks. These are dramatic changes that are often one-per-creature (you couldnâ€™t take multiple transformation keystones on one creature because they exclude each other). They serve as *pinnacle choices* on the tree for advanced customization, analogous to Ascendancy classes in PoE or evolutionary leaps. (This ties into the â€œPinnacle Evolutionâ€ mentioned in Creature Design section â€“ those evolutions may be achieved by taking certain transformation nodes).  
- **Pathing and Branches:** The tree is designed such that **no single creature can cover the entire tree**, creating *opportunity cost*. However, because each creature can go different ways, as a team you can cover a lot of the treeâ€™s benefits indirectly. For example, one creature might go left into a cluster of infernal damage and burn enhancement nodes, becoming your infernal specialist; another goes right into a cluster of defense and healing nodes to be the support tank. If you try to make one creature do everything, youâ€™ll spread its points thin and likely not reach the powerful end nodes in any branch. Thus, **team-wide synergy through specialization** is encouraged â€“ much like a party in an MMO has roles, your creature team can have defined roles amplified by how they travel the passive tree.
**Technician vs Creature Stats:** Importantly, the Motherboard tree **focuses on creature empowerment, not the Technicianâ€™s personal stats**. The Technician acts more as a facilitator. There may be a small section or separate â€œTechnician mini-treeâ€ for things like capturing chance, or out-of-combat utility, but the main tree is about improving creatures in battle. This is intentional to keep the focus on creature strategy rather than turning the Technician into a combatant (which in Mythoras, the Technician doesnâ€™t fight directly). So you wonâ€™t see nodes that say â€œTechnician +10% HPâ€ (since the Tech doesnâ€™t have HP in battle), but you will see â€œCreatures in front row get +X Armourâ€ or â€œcreature gains +5 Authorityâ€ etc.
Finally, **Respeccing** the Motherboard tree will be possible albeit with some cost (perhaps an in-game currency or a limited resource allows unlearning a node). This encourages commitment to a plan but doesnâ€™t permanently lock players if they want to change strategy or when new content demands different approaches.
The Motherboard Passive Tree, in essence, provides the **macro-level progression** for creatures. It ties the team together under one customizable framework, ensuring that progression is not just about grinding XP to level up, but making meaningful choices about *how* you want to strengthen each creature. It captures the feel of an expansive ARPG skill tree (the excitement of planning routes and finding powerful synergies) within a monster RPG context, giving Mythoras a distinct strategic layer beyond what traditional creature-collectors offer.

**Ailment & tag system:** 
Moves carry tags (elements, weapon type, condition) that interact with gear affixes and passive nodes. Status ailments follow familiar patterns from PokÃ©mon â€“ burn lowers physical power, freeze immobilises, paralysis reduces speed, poison deals damage over time, sleep prevents acting. Volatile effects include exposure (reduces resistances), bleed, tether (movement restriction), and fear (forces movement).
-> Ailments and Status Effects  
Status effects (ailments) in Mythoras: Shattered Realms are designed to be a **layer of tactical depth** rather than a simple luck-based gimmick. Instead of binary on/off statuses with fixed probabilities (as in PokÃ©monâ€™s 10% chances or fixed-duration status), Mythoras implements a **scalable ailment system** influenced by *Path of Exile 2â€™s approach to ailments*, where the severity and duration of an ailment can scale with the actions that caused it and the targetâ€™s attributes ([PoE 2 Guide: Freeze Explained](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/freeze#:~:text=Any%20Cold%20Damage%20in%20a,Freeze%20on%20stronger%20Monsters%20such)). This allows for more nuanced interplay, counterplay, and build specialization around applying or resisting status effects.
**Ailment Severity and Buildup:** Every ailment has a concept of *intensity*. Rather than simply â€œinflicted or notâ€, an ailment can be applied in degrees. For example, **Electrocute** might have a scaling vector that enables a far harsher outcome:
- *Light Electrocute:* the creature has a minor speed reduction or a small chance to have its action delayed.
- *Moderate Electrocute:* significant speed reduction, moderate chance to fail acting in a phase.
- *Full Electrocute:* the creature is completely unable to act for the duration (similar to the traditional Electrocute).  
When an attack capable of causing Electrocute hits, the level inflicted depends on how much it â€œexceeds a thresholdâ€ of the target. For instance, a move might have a *Electrocute potency* value that is compared to the targetâ€™s **Electrocute Tolerance**. If it barely meets the threshold, only Light Electrocute is applied; if it greatly exceeds, maybe Full Electrocute is applied. This is akin to PoE2â€™s idea that the chance or strength of freeze/shock scales with damage dealt relative to enemy threshold ([PoE 2 Guide: Freeze Explained](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/freeze#:~:text=Any%20Cold%20Damage%20in%20a,Freeze%20on%20stronger%20Monsters%20such)) ([PoE 2 Guide: Freeze Explained](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/freeze#:~:text=Ailment%20Threshold%20to%20inflict%20Freeze%2C,instead%20add%20to%20Freeze%20Buildup)). Similarly, continuous or repeated application can stack: multiple shocks from electric moves might escalate an enemyâ€™s Electrocute from light -> moderate -> full if done in one battle.
**Ailment Types and Examples:** We plan to have a robust list of ailments, each with tiered effects. Some examples:
- **Ignite (Escalates into Burn) (Another variant could be Scarred):** A infernal-based Damage over Time (DoT). Has two branching paths that ignite can escalate into Burn or Scarred (possibly call it something else). Burn increases damage over time multiplier to ignite. 
- **Chill (Escalates into Freeze):** A cold-based immobilization. *Chill* (minor cold ailment) slows the creature (like Light Freeze), *Freeze* (major) completely encases them preventing action for a short time. Duration or strength depends on cold damage dealt vs tolerance ([PoE 2 Guide: Freeze Explained](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/freeze#:~:text=Any%20Cold%20Damage%20in%20a,Freeze%20on%20stronger%20Monsters%20such)).
- **Shock (Potential conjunction with Electrocute but single ailment entity):** An electric ailment making the target more vulnerable. Shock effect magnitude can be scaled to increase overall damage amplification.
- **Electrocute/Electrocute (Potential conjunction with Shock):** An electric oriented that requires external investment (not intrinisic of electric damage unlike Shock). Ailment makes the target action speed 0.
- **Bleed:** Physical wound DoT. Minor bleed = small ongoing damage, major bleed (Hemorrhage) = heavy damage over time and perhaps additional effects like reduced healing on target.
- **Poison:** A stacking toxin. Each application adds to a poison counter; at certain thresholds it advances in severity (e.g., minor poison slows healing, moderate causes damage, major causes heavy damage and stat debuffs as the creature is really weakened).
- **Stagger or Stun:** A momentary incapacity. This one might not have a long â€œdurationâ€ but severity could influence how long the stun lasts or how easily it can be reapplied. Minor stagger might just push an action to the next phase, while a full stun makes them miss a turn entirely.
- **Fear (Escalates into Nightmare) (Mind ailment):** Minor confusion = occasionally mis-target an attack or small chance to fumble, major confusion = high chance to lose turn or even hurt itself.
- **Corrosion (Armour reduction):** Only affects those with Armour. Minor = a few points of Armour broken, major = Armour greatly reduced or broken entirely for a time.
- etc. (Exact ailments will cover a range of elemental and non-elemental effects; importantly, each is scalable.)
**Tolerance and Resistance:** Each creature has **Tolerance thresholds** for different ailment categories (possibly tied to attributes or explicit stats). For example, a creature might have a Electrocute Tolerance of 20, meaning any Electrocute application must have a potency above 20 to even cause Light Electrocute, and higher tiers might require hitting 50 for Moderate, 80 for Full, etc. These thresholds can be modified by affixes (e.g. an item that gives â€œ+15 to Shock Toleranceâ€) or by temporary buffs. This way, building a â€œresilientâ€ creature against certain debuffs is an option â€“ you could, for instance, deliberately gear your tank creature to be highly resistant to crowd control (raising its tolerance so most enemy stuns only cause a brief stagger at most). Some creatures might naturally excel at certain tolerances (a *Nocturne* origin creature might shrug off mental effects like fear/con
**Application Mechanics:** Ailments are applied via moves or affixes that have tags like *Ailment: Burn (50)* indicating a burn potency of 50. When used:
- If the targetâ€™s Burn Tolerance is below 50, the target accumulates â€œBurn buildupâ€ based on the potency. Perhaps it fills a meter or percentage. Once the buildup exceeds 100%, the target is officially suffering the ailment at some tier ([PoE 2 Guide: Freeze Explained](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/freeze#:~:text=Any%20Cold%20Damage%20in%20a,with%20the%20exception%20of%20stronger)) ([PoE 2 Guide: Freeze Explained](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/freeze#:~:text=Ailment%20Threshold%20to%20inflict%20Freeze%2C,instead%20add%20to%20Freeze%20Buildup)). The amount over 100% could determine if itâ€™s minor or major. Alternatively, crossing threshold X applies minor, crossing a higher threshold Y without the ailment being cleared upgrades it to major.
- Repeated hits can stack the buildup. For example, a burn move with potency 30 used twice in quick succession (and the target tolerance is say 20) might push the burn from minor to major. This encourages either focused application of an ailment by one creature or teamwork (two creatures both inflicting Poison can stack up a deadly toxin faster).
- Some ailments might decay if not continually applied (like poison counters dropping off slowly), adding a timing element.
- Critical hits or special conditions could bypass some tolerance (e.g., a critical burn might jump straight to a higher severity).
**Major vs Minor Effects:** The design is such that minor ailments provide *soft hindrance* (no fight should be decided purely because one minor ailment landed), but major ailments can be fight-changing if you allow them to escalate. For instance, a Minor Electrocute might simply make a creature act last in the next phase (annoying but not catastrophic), whereas a Full Electrocute might make it skip its action entirely, which is a big deal. This gives counterplay: if you see an enemy trying to stack an ailment on you, you might switch that creature out or use a preventative measure before it becomes major.
**Avoiding Pure Randomness:** We intentionally avoid the PokÃ©mon-style â€œ10% chance to instantly inflict a strong ailmentâ€. Instead, chance in Mythoras mainly comes from whether an attack had enough impact. A weak infernal hit might only have, say, 40% of the burn threshold â€“ it singes but doesnâ€™t ignite the foe fully (in-game this might appear as just a flavor message or a very minor burn that quickly fades). Strong hits or repeated hits reliably cause status. There might still be *some* randomness (crits or slight variances in potency), but overall itâ€™s much more deterministic and based on stats. This means players can plan around ailments more reliably â€“ both offensively and defensively.
**Ailment Interactions and Strategy:** Because of the scaling nature, entire builds can be made around maximizing ailment application. For example:
- A creature might specialize in infernal damage to reliably cause Severe Burns on enemies, adding constant pressure. They might take passives like â€œBurn damage increased per point of Authorityâ€ to boost that strategy.
- Another creature could be built as an â€œAilment applierâ€ with multiple moves that each apply different stacks (poison + bleed combination to slowly cripple high-HP enemies). Perhaps if a target has both bleed and poison at major severity, a special combo effect triggers (like increased damage taken, akin to a synergy).
- On the flip side, an opponent in a tournament might have a team built around heavy stun-lock, so the player might adapt by fielding a creature that has an affix â€œImmunity to Minor Stunsâ€ or very high tolerance.
We also introduce the idea of **Ailment Combos**: if certain ailments are present simultaneously, new effects occur. This is inspired by some games where combining effects yields bonuses (like in some JRPGs, freeze + shatter, etc.). For instance, an enemy under **Wet** (a tidal debuff) who is then hit by a lightning move might get a bonus ailment *Electrocution* that causes a special high-damage shock due to the combo. Or a creature on infernal (Burning) that is then *Shocked* could experience a short-circuit effect causing immediate damage spike. These synergies make multi-domain teams interesting and bring the Origin/Domain system (see next section) into play with status interactions.
**Cleansing and Mitigation:** To avoid frustration, there will be ways to mitigate and cure ailments. Moves or items that provide **cleansing** (remove one or all ailment stacks from a creature), though these might come with cooldowns or other costs to prevent trivializing the system. There could be a tension in battles: do I spend a turn cleansing my creature now (losing offense tempo) or do I risk one more turn and hope the ailment doesnâ€™t reach a worse tier? Since nothing is purely RNG sudden death, a player should rarely feel completely robbed by an ailment â€“ they will see it coming (e.g. â€œmy creature has 70% freeze buildup, next big cold hit might freeze them solid â€“ I should actâ€).
**Tolerance as a Stat vs Fixed Immunities:** Instead of binary immunities (like PokÃ©mon where some types just canâ€™t be poisoned, etc.), Mythoras mostly uses the tolerance values. For example, an *Undead* themed creature might effectively be â€œimmuneâ€ to poison because its Poison Tolerance is extremely high, so normal poison moves canâ€™t reach threshold (unless an enemy specifically builds to overcome that, which could be very difficult). This is a more organic way of handling immunities that still fits the system. Some special cases might exist (a creature might be outright immune to one specific ailment by lore, e.g., a lava golem might naturally be immune to burn because itâ€™s already on infernal), but these are exceptions and often represented by a very high tolerance or a trait like â€œBurning Heart: cannot be burnedâ€.
**Ailments in Passive Tree and Affixes:** There will be passive nodes and affixes that interact with this system:
- E.g., passive node â€œInfection Mastery: +30% Poison buildup rate, poison you inflict lasts longerâ€.
- Affix example on gear: â€œPrefix: Contagious â€“ Ailments applied by this creature spread to another random enemy at 50% intensity.â€
- Or a suffix: â€œof Antidotes â€“ This creature reduces all incoming Poison buildup by 40%â€ making it resistant.
- Moves could also have variants that trade base damage for higher ailment application, etc.
This robust Ailment system aims to provide an **incremental, feedback-driven status dynamic** in battles. Skilled players will leverage ailments to turn the tide or craft specific counters, and battles will have an additional layer of strategy beyond raw damage: managing and manipulating the status game. It also adds storytelling flair â€“ battles can become struggles to endure and outlast (will your creature succumb to the stacking poison, or can it finish the foe in time?), reminiscent of high-stakes RPG encounters. Overall, it reinforces the philosophy of depth over randomness, ensuring status effects are a meaningful part of the tactical landscape in Mythoras.

UI & configuration systems
-> Game View 
-> Hub View
--> Two distinct views that can be toggled between. One screen for the overworld (can be configured to be smaller) and then the hub view is similar to Football Manager dashboard that allows for further management of the player, team, and other general game information/systems like Finances, Scouting, etc... This might be similar to a UI change to see the passive tree in Path of Exile. It is a way to allow players to have a more detailed view of their team and the game state while still being able to see the overworld and other information.

Assembly management: A management dashboard reminiscent of Football Managerâ€™s user interface improvements. Football Manager 2010 introduced a revamped interface making it simpler and quicker to find information, a match analysis tool to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses of opposing team members and make tactical changes. Mythoras uses similar concepts â€“ sortable tables for creature stats, synergy charts, scouting reports and formation tools to design battle squads.

Inventory & stash: A multiâ€‘tab stash stores player's items with affinities and querying to help sort gear more effectively. Gear, consumables, imprints, Engine Jewels and crafting currencies. Filters and search help manage large inventories. The stash can be shared across Assemblies or leagues (with restrictions to prevent exploitation).

Progression & world structure
Campaign:
-> A new region introduces a whole new way to traverse the world every season. This enables us to build out our world in a way that is never repetitive inspired heavily by Pokemon. However, unlike Pokemon, our world while setup similar to their route system will act as instances that can generate different map layouts and potentially affecting encounters of creatures inspired by Path of Exile. The idea is that each region is a new experience and can be approached differently. We will likely have something that relates to the 8 gym badge challenge followed by an Elite 4 into a final showdown with a champion. This then leads into the endgame where the lore for the champion is having to help with a huge narrative that has been building up and hinted at throughout the campaign called the Network Cipher. Similar to Path of Exile's Atlas of Worlds, the Cipher is a collection of traversed zones enabling players to play highly specific map content to improve their builds and challenge the hardest content in the game.
Leagueâ€‘based expansions: Mythoras adopts PoEâ€™s league model â€“ permanent leagues for persistent characters and challenge leagues that provide a fresh start with new mechanics. In PoE, leagues represent game worlds; characters exist only in one league and cannot interact with others. Challenge leagues release roughly every 13â€“16 weeks, adding new mechanics, expansion content, challenges and balance changes. Mythoras seasons follow a similar cadence: each expedition introduces a new region, creatures, league mechanics and endgame activities. After a league ends, characters transfer to the permanent league.
Campaign to endgame: The base campaign guides players through introductory regions, culminating in story bosses. Postâ€‘campaign, players engage with endgame expeditions: randomised maps, multiâ€‘boss gauntlets, and pinnacle encounters. Path of Exileâ€™s Secrets of the Atlas expansion added a new endgame storyline and bosses. Mythoras will do likewise, adding new pinnacle bosses and unique loot each expansion.
World growth: Regions unlock progressively, with dynamic events and day/night cycles. Each region offers dungeons, puzzle shrines, and rare creatures. Future updates may add towns that function as online hubs similar to PoEâ€™s instanced town areas.
Scouting & world configuration: Before entering a region, players can scout to learn about climate, enemies, loot tables and hidden events. Scouting consumes resources and yields knowledge used in Assembly planning. In future, players may send NPC scouts to discover rare creatures or items.
League economy & loot tables: Item drops follow rarity tiers. A loot filter reduces clutter and emphasises valuable drops.Random affixes on gear and consumables come from weighted loot tables; players can craft via currency items reminiscent of PoEâ€™s Orbs.
-> An Atlas Passive Tree will be added to the endgame which will allow players to further specialise their endgame activities and creating farming strategies and building target farms to acquire specific items necessary to progress.

Security model: Tauri emphasises a securityâ€‘first approach. The philosophy page notes that defenseâ€‘inâ€‘depth is key; developers can choose which API endpoints to ship, randomize functional handles at runtime and minimise attack surface. Mythoras runs core game logic in Rust (via Tauri) to prevent tampering. When online features arrive, the authoritative server will validate actions, replicate game state and handle trades; the client will never be trusted with critical logic. This design follows the principle of never trusting the client, which is one reason PoE is onlineâ€‘only and does not provide offline mode.
