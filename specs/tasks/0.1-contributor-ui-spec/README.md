Task 0.1 — Contributor-focused UI spec

Purpose
- Create a single, opinionated contributor-facing specification that documents core UI elements, interaction contracts, accessibility expectations, and how panels should be composed so they can be reused across the app.

Contents
- `CONTRIBUTOR_UI_SPEC.md` — detailed UI element descriptions and conventions (primary artifact).
- `ARCHIVE_DECISIONS.md` — short description of which panels were archived and why.

Outcome
- A clear, language-agnostic reference for contributors implementing panels and interactive UI elements.
